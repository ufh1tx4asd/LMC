IFW-739

* fix(createConnector): new life cycles (#2357)

* fix(createConnector): new life cycles

- move willMount -> constructor
- move willReceiveProps -> didUpdate

This didn't have an impact on more requests, but did cause one more render if you update a prop

IFW-671

* remove comment

* test(sCU): shouldComponentUpdate is called two separate times now

* refactor(lodash): remove fill (#2454)

I replaced this by the `range` utility merged earlier, since it's basically what was needed here.

IFW-741

* refactor(lodash): remove difference (#2455)

Both are arrays & always defined, so it's really enough to find all props in this._props (prevProps), but not in `props`

* refactor(lodash): remove zipWith (#2459)

* refactor(lodash): remove zipWith

IFW-737

* chore: add comment back

* refactor(lodash): replace isFinite (#2458)

* refactor(lodash): replace isFinite

lodash.isFinite is just `typeof value == 'number' && nativeIsFinite(value);`, so that's what I implemented

IFW-745

* chore: remove needless typeof

* refactor(lodash): isPlainObject (#2460)

* refactor(lodash): isPlainObject

The values this function was used for seemed like they can only be arrays or objects to me.

We will only want to empty out ""breadth-first"", so empty objects will stay in the output if they became empty because of the function itself.

isEmpty here is removed in #2442, and still works the same (but will need a rebase)

The newly added tests also pass with the previous implementation

The function is only used in `onSearchStateChange` as a response to a `cleanUp` (caused by unmount) on a widget

IFW-743

* test: remove only

* chore(ts): use `unknown`

* refactor(lodash): replace find (#2446)

Chosen to duplicate the funciton in core & dom, because we have no good way to share functionality otherwise

IFW-740

* refactor(lodash): has (#2434)

* refactor(lodash): has

replace mostly by item[key] === undefined, which isn't completely the same, but close enough in our case, since rendering undefined would be quite weird.

translation will render default value if passed undefined as value

* chore(lodash): remove imports

* feat(get): accept array & bracked-separated string

this will go down afterwards, but for now there's some more duplication

* refactor(lodash): isEmpty (#2442)

* refactor(lodash): orderBy (#2462)

* refactor(lodash): orderBy

The utility is copied from the helper (which passed all lodash tests), I put it inline in the connector, since it's not used in any other spot.

IFW-746

* refactor(menu): remove orderBy & use helper method

These tests provide no security at all, but this change in behaviour can be confirmed in the stories.

* chore(indexUtils): make usage simpler

I caught this when trying to refactor the tests to use a real helper, but eventually decided not to do that

* chore: update test name

IFW-778

closes #2468

* fix(peerDependencies): update React (#2626)

* fix(peerDependencies): update React

We are now relying on React 16.3 features like `static getDerivedStateFromProps` in the library, which thus won't work with lower versions.

The lowest version of React Native which requires React 16.3 (albeit an alpha) is 0.54.0.

This is no longer necessary, since we now require React 16.3 as a peer dependency (#2626)

* docs(stories): remove stories whoich highlight a custom root (#2645)

This has been removed in #2339, so no longer works (nor necessary)

* fix(geo): check for undefined in isEqual (#2643)

issue introduced in #2467

IFW-851

* fix(highlight): switch to index as key (#2690)

the reason is that the full value could be duplicate, so we added the index; but the index can't be duplicate within the list.

* feat(autocomplete): add queryID & position to provided hits (#2687)

* feat(autocomplete): add queryID to provided hits if defined

This was accidentally forgotten when we added the queryID to hits & infinite hits.

IFW-902

* feat(autocomplete): add absolute position too

* Update packages/react-instantsearch-core/src/connectors/__tests__/connectAutoComplete.js

* fix(core): searchState can be non-Object object (#2722)

* fix(core): searchState can be non-Object object

If someone calls `Object.create(null)` and then adds the expected properties, `hasOwnProperty` will not be available on the object itself. 

fixes #2568

* fix(ssr): avoid duplicate serializing (#2726)

* fix(ssr): avoid duplicate serializing

Response of `findResultsState` (and `resultsState` prop) before:

```js
const resultsState = {
  content: SearchResults(state: searchParameters, results: rawResults),
  state: searchParameters,
  _originalResponse: {
    results: rawResults
  },
};
```

Note that `SearchResults` has the properties `_rawResults` & `_state`. This means that when we serialize, we are retrieving the original response and state twice.

Then on further searching, I also find that we don't need to serialize the `SearchResults` object at all, since only the raw response and state is used.

I modified this to be more consistent and no longer have duplication:

```js
const resultsState = {
  state: searchParameters,
  rawResults,
};
```

The `SearchParameters` object gets serialized without issue, as before.

This change in shape has of course also an impact on the shape of `resultsState`, the prop, but that is fine, since it was previously typed as `any`.

To be able to type it correctly, I had to add `@types/algoliasearch` & update `algoliasearch-helper` for typescript though.

This was initially noticed by @cloakedninjas, thanks!

  remove small typo

* chore(context): migrate Panel (#2203)

* chore(context): migrate Panel

This migration is fairly straightforward, and has no impact on how the PanelCallbackHandler is used, although it adds a new component in that tree so it can read the context

IFW-485

* refactor(lodash): pick (#2432)

* refactor(lodash): pick

replaced by destructuring

* chore: remove isEmpty variable

* chore(utils): rename to TS

* chore(TS): rename dom utils

* chore(TS): add minor types to dom utils

* chore(TS): ignore lint rule

* refactor(lodash): range (#2444)

IFW-739

* fix(createConnector): new life cycles (#2357)

* fix(createConnector): new life cycles

- move willMount -> constructor
- move willReceiveProps -> didUpdate

This didn't have an impact on more requests, but did cause one more render if you update a prop

IFW-671

* remove comment

* test(sCU): shouldComponentUpdate is called two separate times now

* refactor(lodash): remove fill (#2454)

I replaced this by the `range` utility merged earlier, since it's basically what was needed here.

IFW-741

* refactor(lodash): remove difference (#2455)

Both are arrays & always defined, so it's really enough to find all props in this._props (prevProps), but not in `props`

* refactor(lodash): remove zipWith (#2459)

* refactor(lodash): remove zipWith

IFW-737

* chore: add comment back

* refactor(lodash): replace isFinite (#2458)

* refactor(lodash): replace isFinite

lodash.isFinite is just `typeof value == 'number' && nativeIsFinite(value);`, so that's what I implemented

IFW-745

* chore: remove needless typeof

* refactor(lodash): isPlainObject (#2460)

* refactor(lodash): isPlainObject

The values this function was used for seemed like they can only be arrays or objects to me.

We will only want to empty out ""breadth-first"", so empty objects will stay in the output if they became empty because of the function itself.

isEmpty here is removed in #2442, and still works the same (but will need a rebase)

The newly added tests also pass with the previous implementation

The function is only used in `onSearchStateChange` as a response to a `cleanUp` (caused by unmount) on a widget

IFW-743

* test: remove only

* chore(ts): use `unknown`

* refactor(lodash): replace find (#2446)

Chosen to duplicate the funciton in core & dom, because we have no good way to share functionality otherwise

IFW-740

* refactor(lodash): has (#2434)

* refactor(lodash): has

replace mostly by item[key] === undefined, which isn't completely the same, but close enough in our case, since rendering undefined would be quite weird.

BREAKING CHANGE:
translation will render default value if passed undefined as value

* chore(lodash): remove imports

* fix(translation): allow undefined value to be passed on purpose

*  refactor(lodash): replace isEqual (#2467)

* refactor(lodash): replace isEqual

1. specified function for maps

IFW-735

* refactor(lodash): replace isEqual with fast-deep-equal

* refactor(lodash): replace omit (#2466)

* refactor(lodash): omit (dom)

In this case, you can simply override a prop, which will take preference, like in any other object.

* refactor(omit): use internal (babel) replacement

* refactor(omit): use destructuring replacement

* refactor(indexUtils): use new omit where possible

* refactor(indexutils): remove omit with path

* chore: fix merge

* chore(size): update

* feat(searchClient): remove other options

* chore(examples): add algoliasearch as dependency

* chore(stories): memoize search client

* refactor(lodash): orderBy (#2462)

* refactor(lodash): orderBy

The utility is copied from the helper (which passed all lodash tests), I put it inline in the connector, since it's not used in any other spot.

IFW-746

* refactor(menu): remove orderBy & use helper method

These tests provide no security at all, but this change in behaviour can be confirmed in the stories.

* chore(indexUtils): make usage simpler

I caught this when trying to refactor the tests to use a real helper, but eventually decided not to do that

closes #2468

* fix(peerDependencies): update React (#2626)

* fix(peerDependencies): update React

We are now relying on React 16.3 features like `static getDerivedStateFromProps` in the library, which thus won't work with lower versions.

The lowest version of React Native which requires React 16.3 (albeit an alpha) is 0.54.0.

* fix(geo): remove lifecycle compat (#2644)

This is no longer necessary, since we now require React 16.3 as a peer dependency (#2626)

* docs(stories): remove stories whoich highlight a custom root (#2645)

This has been removed in #2339, so no longer works (nor necessary)

* fix(geo): check for undefined in isEqual (#2643)

issue introduced in #2467

IFW-851

* fix(highlight): switch to index as key (#2690)

the reason is that the full value could be duplicate, so we added the index; but the index can't be duplicate within the list.

* feat(autocomplete): add queryID & position to provided hits (#2687)

* feat(autocomplete): add queryID to provided hits if defined

This was accidentally forgotten when we added the queryID to hits & infinite hits.

IFW-902

* feat(autocomplete): add absolute position too

* Update packages/react-instantsearch-core/src/connectors/__tests__/connectAutoComplete.js

* fix(core): searchState can be non-Object object (#2722)

* fix(core): searchState can be non-Object object

If someone calls `Object.create(null)` and then adds the expected properties, `hasOwnProperty` will not be available on the object itself. 

fixes #2568

* fix(ssr): avoid duplicate serializing (#2726)

* fix(ssr): avoid duplicate serializing

Response of `findResultsState` (and `resultsState` prop) before:

```js
const resultsState = {
  content: SearchResults(state: searchParameters, results: rawResults),
  state: searchParameters,
  _originalResponse: {
    results: rawResults
  },
};
```

Note that `SearchResults` has the properties `_rawResults` & `_state`. This means that when we serialize, we are retrieving the original response and state twice.

Then on further searching, I also find that we don't need to serialize the `SearchResults` object at all, since only the raw response and state is used.

I modified this to be more consistent and no longer have duplication:

```js
const resultsState = {
  state: searchParameters,
  rawResults,
};
```

The `SearchParameters` object gets serialized without issue, as before.

This change in shape has of course also an impact on the shape of `resultsState`, the prop, but that is fine, since it was previously typed as `any`.

To be able to type it correctly, I had to add `@types/algoliasearch` & update `algoliasearch-helper` for typescript though.

This was initially noticed by @cloakedninjas, thanks!

### Features

* **autocomplete:** add queryID & position to provided hits ([#2687](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2687)) ([e453dab](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/e453dab))
* **client:** remove algoliaClient, appId & apiKey ([#2338](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2338)) ([b84a0b5](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/b84a0b5))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **lodash:** no longer do we allow paths like `attribute[5].something`, or other indexed forms, only `.` is allowed as special key.

All existing tests still pass, and we never documented you could use `lodash.get` patterns other than `.`.

* docs(connectors): fix spelling [STEP 8] (#2190)

  These are misc fixes in spelling that didn't exactly fit in a different PR

  remove small typo

* chore(context): migrate Panel (#2203)

* chore(context): migrate Panel

This migration is fairly straightforward, and has no impact on how the PanelCallbackHandler is used, although it adds a new component in that tree so it can read the context

IFW-485

* refactor(lodash): pick (#2432)

* refactor(lodash): pick

replaced by destructuring

* chore: remove isEmpty variable

* chore(utils): rename to TS

* chore(TS): rename dom utils

* chore(TS): add minor types to dom utils

* chore(TS): ignore lint rule

* refactor(lodash): range (#2444)

IFW-739

* fix(createConnector): new life cycles (#2357)

* fix(createConnector): new life cycles

- move willMount -> constructor
- move willReceiveProps -> didUpdate

This didn't have an impact on more requests, but did cause one more render if you update a prop

IFW-671

* remove comment

* test(sCU): shouldComponentUpdate is called two separate times now

* refactor(lodash): remove fill (#2454)

I replaced this by the `range` utility merged earlier, since it's basically what was needed here.

IFW-741

* refactor(lodash): remove difference (#2455)

Both are arrays & always defined, so it's really enough to find all props in this._props (prevProps), but not in `props`

* refactor(lodash): remove zipWith (#2459)

* refactor(lodash): remove zipWith

IFW-737

* chore: add comment back

* refactor(lodash): replace isFinite (#2458)

* refactor(lodash): replace isFinite

lodash.isFinite is just `typeof value == 'number' && nativeIsFinite(value);`, so that's what I implemented

IFW-745

* chore: remove needless typeof

* refactor(lodash): isPlainObject (#2460)

* refactor(lodash): isPlainObject

The values this function was used for seemed like they can only be arrays or objects to me.

We will only want to empty out ""breadth-first"", so empty objects will stay in the output if they became empty because of the function itself.

isEmpty here is removed in #2442, and still works the same (but will need a rebase)

The newly added tests also pass with the previous implementation

The function is only used in `onSearchStateChange` as a response to a `cleanUp` (caused by unmount) on a widget

IFW-743

* test: remove only

* chore(ts): use `unknown`

* refactor(lodash): replace find (#2446)

Chosen to duplicate the funciton in core & dom, because we have no good way to share functionality otherwise

IFW-740

* refactor(lodash): has (#2434)

* refactor(lodash): has

replace mostly by item[key] === undefined, which isn't completely the same, but close enough in our case, since rendering undefined would be quite weird.

BREAKING CHANGE:
translation will render default value if passed undefined as value

* chore(lodash): remove imports

* fix(translation): allow undefined value to be passed on purpose

*  refactor(lodash): replace isEqual (#2467)

* refactor(lodash): replace isEqual

1. specified function for maps

IFW-735

* refactor(lodash): replace isEqual with fast-deep-equal

* refactor(lodash): replace omit (#2466)

* refactor(lodash): omit (dom)

In this case, you can simply override a prop, which will take preference, like in any other object.

* refactor(omit): use internal (babel) replacement

* refactor(omit): use destructuring replacement

* refactor(indexUtils): use new omit where possible

* refactor(indexutils): remove omit with path

* chore: fix merge

* chore(size): update

* chore(life cycle): add comments where change is necessary

* fix(compat): upgrade SearchBox lifecycle (#2288)

* chore(examples): add algoliasearch as dependency

* chore(stories): memoize search client

* chore: update proptype

* refactor(lodash): get (#2461)

* refactor(lodash): get

IFW-742

BREAKING CHANGE: no longer do we allow paths like `attribute[5].something`, or other indexed forms, only `.` is allowed as special key.

All existing tests still pass, and we never documented you could use `lodash.get` patterns other than `.`.

* feat(get): accept array & bracked-separated string

moved to utils at the same time

* fix typo

* feedback: test for undefined behaviour

* chore(size): update expectation

this will go down afterwards, but for now there's some more duplication

* refactor(lodash): isEmpty (#2442)

* refactor(lodash): isEmpty

reusing objectHasKeys strategy from the helper

IFW-736

* refactor(lodash): remove isEmpty from server

* chore(TS): clearer type

* feedback: don't use objectHasKeys for array

* fix implementation

* refactor(example): remove lodash

* fix(numeric): correct reimplementation of !isEmpty

* chore(size): update expectation

somewhat bigger for now, but in the long run it'll shrink

* fix(compat): upgrade React Router example lifecycles (#2307)

* fix(compat): upgrade React Router v3 example lifecycles (#2314)

* fix(compat): upgrade React Native example and its lifecycles (#2304)

* fix(compat): upgrade Next.js example lifecycles (#2379)

* fix(compat): update Next example

* fix(compat): use last Next router

* fix(createInstantSearchManager): do not trigger search on index update (#2552)

* fix(createInstantSearchManager): do not trigger search on index update

* feat(ssr): update the SSR API (#2555)

* feat(ssr): only expose findResultsState [PART-1] (#2536)

* feat(ssr): hydrate client [PART-2] (#2537)

* feat(ssr): update usage of the API [PART-3]

* refactor(root): remove createIndex & createInstantSearch (#2339)

* refactor(InstantSearch): migrate life cycles (#2349)

*  fix(createInstantSearchManager): fix multi-index search  (#2570)

* fix(createInstantSearchManager): fix multi-index search

* Fix tests

* Update bundlesize

* Map indexName prop to indexId when indexId is not defined

* Add tests

* Pass indexName through variable for clarity

* Simplify test

* Simplify other tests

* refactor(lodash): orderBy (#2462)

* refactor(lodash): orderBy

The utility is copied from the helper (which passed all lodash tests), I put it inline in the connector, since it's not used in any other spot.

IFW-746

* refactor(menu): remove orderBy & use helper method

These tests provide no security at all, but this change in behaviour can be confirmed in the stories.

* chore(indexUtils): make usage simpler

I caught this when trying to refactor the tests to use a real helper, but eventually decided not to do that

* chore: update test name

* chore: different if style

* chore(test): simplify

* chore: update sizes

* chore(size): looser limit

* simplify code

* chore: update bundlesize

* chore(lint): remove wrong merges

* chore(react-native): roll back react version

* chore(lint): small fix

* chore(ssr): fix example build

* chore(lodash): remove dependencies (#2600)

- lodash from packages
- babel-plugin-lodash from root
- swap out isEqual from connectInfiniteHits

IFW-778

closes #2468

* fix(peerDependencies): update React (#2626)

* fix(peerDependencies): update React

We are now relying on React 16.3 features like `static getDerivedStateFromProps` in the library, which thus won't work with lower versions.

The lowest version of React Native which requires React 16.3 (albeit an alpha) is 0.54.0.

* !fixup

* refactor(helper): replace Helper usage (#2621)

* docs(MIGRATION): migrate to v6 (#2627)

* docs(MIGRATION): migrate to v6

* docs(MIGRATION): update wording

Co-Authored-By: Haroen Viaene <fingebimus@me.com>
Co-Authored-By: François Chalifour <francoischalifour@users.noreply.github.com>

* docs(MIGRATION): add snippet for appID & apiKey

* docs(MIGRATION): add algoliasearchHelper section

* fix(geo): remove lifecycle compat (#2644)

This is no longer necessary, since we now require React 16.3 as a peer dependency (#2626)

* docs(stories): remove stories whoich highlight a custom root (#2645)

This has been removed in #2339, so no longer works (nor necessary)

* fix(geo): check for undefined in isEqual (#2643)

issue introduced in #2467

IFW-851

* fix(highlight): switch to index as key (#2690)

the reason is that the full value could be duplicate, so we added the index; but the index can't be duplicate within the list.

* feat(autocomplete): add queryID & position to provided hits (#2687)

* feat(autocomplete): add queryID to provided hits if defined

This was accidentally forgotten when we added the queryID to hits & infinite hits.

IFW-902

* feat(autocomplete): add absolute position too

* Update packages/react-instantsearch-core/src/connectors/__tests__/connectAutoComplete.js

* fix(core): searchState can be non-Object object (#2722)

* fix(core): searchState can be non-Object object

If someone calls `Object.create(null)` and then adds the expected properties, `hasOwnProperty` will not be available on the object itself. 

fixes #2568

* fix(ssr): avoid duplicate serializing (#2726)

* fix(ssr): avoid duplicate serializing

Response of `findResultsState` (and `resultsState` prop) before:

```js
const resultsState = {
  content: SearchResults(state: searchParameters, results: rawResults),
  state: searchParameters,
  _originalResponse: {
    results: rawResults
  },
};
```

Note that `SearchResults` has the properties `_rawResults` & `_state`. This means that when we serialize, we are retrieving the original response and state twice.

Then on further searching, I also find that we don't need to serialize the `SearchResults` object at all, since only the raw response and state is used.

I modified this to be more consistent and no longer have duplication:

```js
const resultsState = {
  state: searchParameters,
  rawResults,
};
```

The `SearchParameters` object gets serialized without issue, as before.

This change in shape has of course also an impact on the shape of `resultsState`, the prop, but that is fine, since it was previously typed as `any`.

To be able to type it correctly, I had to add `@types/algoliasearch` & update `algoliasearch-helper` for typescript though.

This was initially noticed by @cloakedninjas, thanks!

* **lodash:** get ([#2461](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2461)) ([527b879](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/527b879))
* **lodash:** has ([#2434](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2434)) ([75a4a15](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/75a4a15))

### Features

* **autocomplete:** add queryID & position to provided hits ([#2687](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2687)) ([e453dab](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/e453dab))
* **client:** remove algoliaClient, appId & apiKey ([#2338](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2338)) ([b84a0b5](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/b84a0b5))
* **context:** migrate to new React context ([#2178](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2178)) ([0a1abea](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/0a1abea)), closes [#2179](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2179) [#2180](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2180) [#2181](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2181) [#2185](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2185) [#2192](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2192) [#2189](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2189) [#2190](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2190) [#2179](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2179) [#2180](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2180) [#2181](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2181) [#2185](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2185) [#2192](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2192) [#2190](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2190)
* **ssr:** update the SSR API ([#2555](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2555)) ([925bdb8](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/commit/925bdb8)), closes [#2536](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2536) [#2537](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/issues/2537)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **lodash:** no longer do we allow paths like `attribute[5].something`, or other indexed forms, only `.` is allowed as special key.

All existing tests still pass, and we never documented you could use `lodash.get` patterns other than `.`.

* feat(get): accept array & bracked-separated string

moved to utils at the same time

* fix typo

* feedback: test for undefined behaviour

* chore(size): update expectation

this will go down afterwards, but for now there's some more duplication
* **lodash:** translation will render default value if passed undefined as value

* chore(lodash): remove imports

* fix(translation): allow undefined value to be passed on purpose

* chore(deps): update examples to react-instantsearch v6.0.0-beta.0

* chore(index): don't require `indexId` on `IndexWrapper` (#2834)

* Don't require `indexId` proptype on Index widget wrapper

* Use unique type for IndexWrapper props

* merge branch master into next

* test(examples): update snapshots (#2845)

* fix(ssr): add error when no indexName is passed (#2",babel react,"
* refactor(omit): use internal (babel) replacement
* refactor(DOMMaps): use new React Context API (#2023)",4,UI,

React
- Dotcomshell
- Masthead
- Footer

Vanilla
- Dotcomshell

- Footer

Each example can also be downloaded from Codesandbox (File > Export to zip) and run in isolation.

- Examples are created directly from the repository directory. Examples used in PR description are from my fork. Once merged we will need to re-test.
- Once build success message appears image, the port must be added to CSB browser, e.g. https://djjl3.sse.codesandbox.io/ becomes https://djjl3-9000.sse.codesandbox.io/.
- Suggest going for a cup of coffee and maybe watching a movie for each example build because they can take a long time.

This also adds Python-2.0 to the list of accepted licenses.

Lastly, it fixes a bug where the package.json files were incorrectly
reordered. For the `exports` of a particular package, the order that
the entrypoints are defined in is crucial. Therefore, we should not
alter the order of entrypoints and instead maintain the originally
defined ordering. We can use an `OrderedDict` to ensure that Python
always loads the JSON files in the same order.

I'm avoiding using the central `gulp/index.js` to create a shared config in favor of configuring tasks explicitly with command line arguments that we parse in the script that npx/yarn executes.

* Build script builds javascript and runs the sass task, but the sass task doesn't seem to be working yet.

* Sass compiling works! And moved the executable script up a level because we're only going to have one now with different commands

* Improved logging and replaced our use of the deprecated gutil library with the recommended alternatives (https://medium.com/gulpjs/gulp-util-ca3b1f9f9ac5)

* Renamed `log-util.js` `logUtil.js` for consistency

* Stats work!

* Added some commented code for the next script/command to be written

* Clean up. I don't know where the name `dutil` came from, but it must be outdated. Removed unused stuff and cleaned up the logging. Also cleaned up the task definitions for the build module

* Calling the script `cmsds` and fixing a typo

* Moved fonts and images into the src folder and changed the build script to move fonts and images from src to dist. And when building child design systems (packages that aren't our core package), it will copy the fonts and images from the core package in node_modules into the child design system's dist folder.

* Clean up comment and allow fonts and images to be copied in parallel

* Added `skiplatest` support to the fonts stats function like we have for the css stats function and added helpful error messaging around skiplatest functionality. Instead of just throwing a bunch of filesystem errors, it will say why it errored and suggest using `--skiplatest` if appropriate.

* Build script copies sass files to dist as well now (but not the `*.docs.scss` ones)

* Updated comments documenting the different build tasks

* Got rid of a common file that doesn't need to exist anymore

* Pared it down to the files that are necessary for the source package build script only

* Renamed the scripts package folder to `design-system-scripts`

* A couple helper functions to clean the cli file up a bit.

* Rename core folder to cmsds and update package.json

* Add back layout to docs package and fix broken links

* Add migration documentation

* PR feedback and other misc documentation changes

* Rename cmsds folder to design-system

* Remove core and layout dep from docs package

* Instead of using gulp tasks, we now just use async functions that have parameters. This makes it so much easier to compose them without having to preconfigure all the tasks with the right parameters, especially when certain parameters may or may not exist depending on which tasks you plan on using. This should be much simpler overall because it's just plain JavaScript. We still use gulp for the streaming transform pipelines, but at a high level, it's just JavaScript.

A note here that I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to consistently detect when a gulp stream had ended. It ended up being a combination of `{ readable: false, writeable: false }` for the `finished` function and placing the `pipe(count(...))` before the `pipe(gulp.dest(...))`. I tried a lot of different methods of detecting stream ends before I realized that it was a combination of those two things.

* Had to update babel and a few other dependencies to fix the build scripts

* Set up the command for building docs, and the `cmsds` script will now print usage if you don't specify a command or specify an invalid one

* Copied the docs scripts in and committing them as a baseline before I start changing them. Refactored the `gulp/webpack.js` module to not use gulp tasks

* Organizing the `gulp/docs` folder a bit more so it's easier to read

* Did a bunch of refactoring of the docs-building tasks, but then I realized that I was still dealing with an array of docs paths in most of these helper functions when I was specifically trying to avoid that. Will fix that next

* A bunch more refactoring. I have a lot of issues to work out still, but the basic structure should be here

* Make the design-system-docs package public so child design systems can include it as a dependency, and make the core package a peer dependency of the scripts package so we can ensure that's available for the build script

* Removed the dependency the docs build script had on a module shared with the docs package itself and fixed a bunch of errors. There are still more errors, but I'm making progress.

* Fixed some more build errors, but now I'm finding that the build path seems to be kind of hard-coded in a lot of places. I need to refactor a lot of these functions in gulp/docs to start their paths from the working directory rather than all these different locations relative to the root of the design-system repo. The nice thing about working out of just this temporary directory is that it should ultimately simplify all these different paths. I just need to untangle it

* Move `docs/index.js` into `docs/docs.js` so it's easier to tell what file I'm working on in my editor

* This commit is about getting the doc page rendering scripts to work, and there are several pieces to that:
- Get babel to work at runtime to import modules from the docs package. There was a problem where when npm-linking the scripts package and the docs package to the node_modules of the repository root we would get incompatible versions of babel. In the end I realized that we were importing `babel-register` which is the old babel 6 version. I had been importing `@babel/register` and didn't realize there was another import of the old package elsewhere. I made a lot of other changes to try to get this to work, but ultimately it was probably as simple as that
- Had to change a lot of paths. Some paths were relative to the module being executed, and some were relative to the cwd.
- Had to feed the github url to the docs package components another way because it needs to work for child design systems that are in other repos
- Changed imports of docs-package modules from using relative paths to treating the docs package as a dependency. It's now required for the docs package to be a peer dependency of the scripts package.
- Fixed other minor issues in the scripts

* Also compile docs package files with babel

* Fixed imports again and also realized that if I specify the path to the relative path to the current directory as the source directory for the script as `.`, I don't have to resolve the paths ahead of time, which keeps them short and sweet until a time when we absolutely need to resolve them to the absolute path.

* This function wasn't actually returning a promise, and this regex didn't cover the docs package if it was inside node_modules anymore. Also created an alias for the build script in the root package.json

* Fix merge mistake

* Fixed more merge mistakes

* Revert to the master version of all the backstop images. This is another merge error.

* Remove grid import from merge

* Remove copying to temp dir, as uniquePage in generatePages handles that already. Simplify copyAssets to be resuable in build-docs

* Fix error in processMarkup originating from processMarkup

* Run webpack statically for docs javascript, move webpack.config.js to design-system-scripts

* Remove postcss inliner and fix image copying

   Reasons to do this change:

   * Bower package manager has been deprecated, and bower officially
recommended to use webpack instead, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower
   * Because github does not check bower packages for vulnerabilities,
we don't know which of our js dependencies now have critical
vulnerablilities.
   * Seems that bower needs phantomjs to do js package handling, which
will need to download it and use bzip2 to unpacking phantomjs package.
Sometimes it will cause build error if the building system does not install
bzip2.
   * For long term consideration of indy operation, we should use tools
with good and much more official support, which bower is lacking now.
   * In the meantime, needs to upgrade some of the current js
dependencies which have vulnerabilities.",bootstrap bower,"bzip2.

* Fix build (v4 not uuidv4)

* uuid direct import and remove externals

* updated from feedback

* is already taken by stripe's session API

* remove uuid and crypto from global configs

* test fixes

* add check for window for redux persist

* feedback edits

* remove parseInt

* using isClient

* using switch case for warnings

* Fixed slice/entry issues; Enhanced dev setup

I was unable to use getters due the formatCurrencyString's reliance on state.currency and state.language. These values are revoked after the Immer is done with the draft state.

## `core/Entry.js`
* Created updateFormattedTotalPrice and updateFormattedValue helper functions
* Avoided passing currency and language down individually
* Avoided both spreading state and passing it down as a prop to each entry function
* Removed duplicate creation of the id value
* Removed unnecessary if statements for price_data and product_data; `{...undefined}` is valid code
* Converted the rest of the entry code to using Immer draft style
* Shortened `x = x + y` and similar to `x += y`
* Changed `updateQuantity` to use `updateEntry` under the hood like it used to
* Fixed quantity/count logic in `updateQuantity`
* Added radix to `parseInt`

## `core/slice.js`
* Formatting
* Remove `redirectToCheckout` and `checkoutSingleItem` from the reducers but still add them to the actions

## `core/store.js`
* A little formatting
* Generate the initial formatted price instead of guessing that they're using USD and English
* Using `isClient` now

## `utilities/serverless.js`
* Formatting
* Move spreading objects inline because `{ ...undefined }` and `{ ...{} }` are still valid

## `.eslintrc`
Added more snake case words we're using to ignore in the camelCase rule

I also fixed the CRA example's package.json so that it will now use our local use-shopping-cart instead of the published one. Make sure to run `yarn` to see this change.

## `examples/cra/functions/create-session.js`
* Added real error handling with status codes and messages

## `netlify.toml` and `package.json`
I edited these files to make the development process easier. I was having some issues with netlify dev so I made the configuration more specific. I also made it so that it won't open localhost:3000 (it really confused me) but will open localhost:8888.

* Remove redundant parseInt()

With warning-middleware.js they are already being warned to not use non-number values.

* Make dev setup better

The netlify dev setup seems to only work if you start your application in another command before running netlify dev. Now you do:

```bash
# terminal 1
yarn dev:cra

# terminal 2
yarn dev
```

* Fix tests

Added price_data and product_data to tests in slice.test.js

Uncommented and skipped all tests in react/index.test.js

* Update labels.yml

* add whitelist for redux persist

* 0 is valid, we use 0 to determine if we should remove item or not

* update tests

* Update rollup config

* Fixed redux-persist warning

The default import for `'redux-persist/lib/storage'` is `createWebStorage('local')` which calls `getStorage` which is causing this error. I replaced this import with my own `createLocalStorage` function.

I also added an option to allow the end-developer to use their own custom `storage`.

* lint

I touched up on the `.eslintrc` file and added a `lint` command to the `package.json`.

* Externalize dependencies

* Add visualizer

* Visualization for both react and core

* beta version bump

* add global variables for UMD

* handling SSR

* handling formattedTotalPrice for clearCart

* update beta and getting started doc

* beta version bump

* added formattedPrice

* switch to use Stripe function rather than loadStripei in middleware

* update formatLineItems to look for id

* update code samples

* added to api

* Remove unused import

* Fixed serverless tests and allow metadata

Fixed issue with tests where formatLineItems wasn't working as expected.

Allowed metadata from cart entry through to line_items and added tests for this.

Fixed up testing structure for serverless.

* Rename test

* add check for sku key and appId in middleware

* added type defs

* failed attempt at compiling TS file

* no more over engineering

* version bump

* Getting rid of optional chaining 

Optional chaining is only available in node 14, this caused some issues on Netlify and I'm worried that those who don't have that environment will be affected.

Resolves #27513.

_This PR is a combination of #31293 (the code changes) + #33570 (test updates). These two PRs were individually reviewed and merged into a feature branch. This combo PR here simply sets up the merge from the feature branch to `master`._

Summary of changes, taken from #31293:

## Before this PR
The Logstash Pipeline Viewer UI would make a single Kibana API call to fetch all the information necessary to render the Logstash pipeline. This included information necessary to render the detail drawer that opens up when a user clicks on an individual vertex in the pipeline.

Naturally, this single API call fetched _a lot_ of data, not just from the Kibana server but also, in turn, from Elasticsearch as well. The ""pro"" of this approach was that the user would see instantaneous results if they clicked on a vertex in a pipeline and opened the detail drawer for that vertex. The ""cons"" were the amount of computation Elasticsearch had to perform and the amount of data being transferred over the wire between Elasticsearch and the Kibana server as well as between the Kibana server and the browser.

## With this PR
This PR makes the Kibana API call to fetch data necessary for **initially** rendering the pipeline — that is, with the detail drawer closed — much lighter. When the user clicks on a vertex in a pipeline, a second API call is then made to fetch data necessary for the detail drawer.

## Gains, by the numbers

Based on a simple, 1-input, 1-filter, and 1-output pipeline.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses (multiple calls were made using the `composite` aggregation over the `date_histogram` aggregation) generated a total of 1228 aggregation buckets (before any `filter_path`s were applied but across all `composite` ""pages""). With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response (note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed) generated 12 buckets (also before any `filter_path`s were applied). That's a **99.02% reduction** in number of buckets.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_stats` API responses added up to 70319 bytes. With this PR, the single `logstash_stats` API response for the same pipeline is 746 bytes. That's a **98.93% reduction** in size.

* Before this PR, the Elasticsearch `logstash_state` API response was 7718 bytes. With this PR, the API response for the same pipeline is 2328 bytes. That's a **69.83% reduction** in size.

* Before this PR the Kibana API response was 51777 bytes. With this PR, the API response for the same pipeline is 2567 bytes (again, note that this is just for the initial rendering of the pipeline, with the detail drawer closed). That's a **95.04% reduction** in size.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Related to #1985. Prior to Embark's minimum supported version of Node.js being
bumped to to 10.17.0, Embark was incompatible with any relatively recent
release of the `ipfs-http-client` package.

While *internal* changes are needed re: ipfs's `Buffer` export for
e.g. `embark_demo` to function correctly *(and this PR makes those changes)*,
Embark otherwise runs/tests okay.

Keep in mind #2033.

However, if a dApp author were to explicitly `require('ifps-api')` in the
front-end that wouldn't work as before; and swapping `""ipfs-http-client""` for
`""ipfs-api""` might also not be enough — there are API changes that dApp authors
would need to consider, regardless of Embark presently supplying the dependency
and EmbarkJS wrapping around it.

embark-framework/embark,ee56f3771389a00e019eadce595dcf30468f0afe,2019-12-13 18:59:47,core-js,babel,"build: implement collective typecheck

This PR replaces #2057.

Implement a collective typecheck action that can be invoked in the root of the
monorepo with `yarn typecheck` or in watch-mode with `yarn watch:typecheck`.
Include the watch-mode typecheck action as part of `yarn start` (a.k.a
`yarn watch`).

To activate collective typecheck for a package in the monorepo, its
`package.json` file should specify:

```
{
  ""embark-collective"": {
    ""typecheck"": true
  }
}
```
*-or-*
```
{
  ""embark-collective"": {
    ""typecheck"": {...}
  }
}
```

Where `{...}` above is a `tsconfig.json` fragment that will be merged into the
config generated for the package according the same rules that `tsc` applies
when merging [configs][config].

When collective typecheck begins, it generates a `tsconfig.json` for the root
of the monorepo and for each package that is activated for the action. If the
generated JSON is different than what's on disk for the respective root/package
config, or if the config is not present on disk, then it will be
written. Changes to generated `tsconfig.json` files should be committed; such
changes will arise when there are structural changes to the monorepo, e.g. a
package is added, removed, moved and/or the directory containing it is
renamed. Since the configs are only generated at the beginning of collective
typecheck, when structural changes are made in the monorepo `yarn typecheck`
(or `yarn start` or `yarn watch:typecheck`) should be restarted.

Nearly all of the packages in the monorepo (i.e. all those for which it makes
sense) have been activated for collective typecheck. Even those packages that
don't contain `.ts` sources are activated because `tsc` can make better sense
of the code base as a whole owing to the project references included in the
generated `tsconfig.json` files. Also, owing to the fully cross-referenced
`tsconfig.json` files, it's possible for `tsc` to type check the whole code
base without babel (`yarn build` or `yarn watch:build`) having been run
beforehand.

**NOTE** that a *""cold typecheck""* of the whole monorepo is resource intensive:
on this author's 2019 MacBook Pro it takes around three minutes, the fans spin
up, and `tsc` uses nearly 0.5 GB of RAM. However, once a full typecheck has
completed, the next full typecheck will complete in a few seconds or less; and
when running in watch-mode there is likewise a *big* speedup once a full
typecheck has completed, whether that full check happened before it's running
in watch-mode or when watch-mode itself resulted in a full check before
switching automatically to incremental check, as well a corresponding *big*
reduction in resource consumption. A full check will be needed any time
`yarn typecheck` (or `yarn start` or `yarn watch:typecheck`) is run in a fresh
clone plus `yarn install`, or after doing `yarn reboot[:full]` or `yarn reset`.

The combination of options in each generated package-level `tsconfig.json` and
the root `tsconfig.base.json` result in `tsc` writing `.d.ts` files (TypeScript
declaration files) into the `dist/` directory of each package. That
output is intended to live side-by-side with babel's output, and therefore the
`""rootDir""` option in each generated config is set to `""./src""`.

In projects activated for collective typecheck, `.js` may be converted to `.ts`
and/or `.ts` sources may be added without any additional changes needed in
package-level `package.json`.

---

Reorganize types in `packages/core/typings` (a.k.a `@types/embark`) into
`packages/core/core` (`embark-core`), refactor other packages' imports
accordingly, and delete `packages/core/typings` from the monorepo. This results
in some similarly named but incompatible types exported from `embark-core`
(e.g. `Events` and `EmbarkEvents`, the latter being the one from
`packages/core/typings`); future refactoring should consolidate those types. To
avoid circular dependency relationships it's also necessary to split out
`Engine` from `embark-core` into its own package (`embark-engine`) and to
introduce a bit of duplication, e.g. the `Maybe` type that's now defined in
both `embark-i18n` and `embark-core`.

In the process of the types reorg, move many dependencies spec'd in various
`package.json` to the `package.json` of the package/s that actually depend on
them, e.g. many are moved from `packages/embark/package.json` to
`packages/core/engine/package.json`. Related to those moves, fix some Node.js
`require`-logic related to bug-prone dependency resolution.

Fix all type errors that appeared as a result of activating collective
typecheck across the whole monorepo.

Reactivate `tslint` in `packages/core/core` and fix the remaining linter errors.

Tidy up and add a few items in the root `package.json` scripts.

Bump lerna from `3.16.4` to `3.19.0`.

Bumpt typescript from `3.6.3` to `3.7.2`.

Bumpt tslint from `5.16.0` to `5.20.1`.

Make various changes related to packages' `import`/`require`ing packages that
weren't spec'd in their respective `package.json`. More refactoring is needed
in this regard, but changes were made as the problems were observed in the
process of authoring this PR.

* Initial pass at upgrading to Storybook 5

* Use Storybook 5.1.0-alpha.28 for fixes and improvements to build process

* webOS fix no longer needed

* Fix Babel target-based polyfilling using core-js 2.

* Transition to latest APIs for addons and addon load order

* Setup browser target scope, and support GENERATE_SOURCEMAP env var to disable source maps when set false.

* 'selectV2' knob is now default 'select' knob

* Update stories for current Storybook info addon.

* Re-add WebOSMetaPlugin

* Update changelog

* Fix first resolve from sampler project-level. Add missing devServer settings.

* Fix linting error

* Use ci mode for serving to avoid iteractive browser auto-popup

* Resolved +/- button issue, boolean knob error, divider story problem, and bad import reference in GridListImageItem

Enact-DCO-1.0-Signed-off-by: Blake Stephens <blake.stephens@lge.com>

* Use Enact-branded dark theme

* Ensure ""show Info"" scrollbar isn't under the close button.

* Updated dependencies for Storybook 5.1.x, including core-js@3 and adding missing classnames dependency.

* CoreJS 3.x polyfilling.

* Revert boolean workaround as it's been fixed upstream.

* Fix zooming margin issue and ensure moonstone panel close button doesn't flow above ""Show Info"" overlay.

* Relocate mobile style fix into a dynamically added style node. Adds styles to hide the zoom-in/zoom-out/zoom-reset/grid buttons since they'd be potential for confusion in testing and resolution independence.

* Convert new stories into Storybook 5 format

* Fix syntax error created during previous `develop` merge.

* PLAT-61282: Limit storybook action logger

* Updated base Storybook requirements for recent fixes.

* Linting fix

* Static class property syntax fix

* addon-knobs seems to require non-falsey labels/default values. Replacing with space character appears to fix the issue and still doesn't appear in ""Show Info"" code output.

* Latest dependencies for Storybook and corejs

* Fix handling default case and empty-case key value for objects

* Fix nullb value to empty string

* Nullify the itemIcon value so it's hidden in source block when null.

* Simplification of logic used in modified select knob

* The Storybook addon-info package requires <Component>.defaultProps to exist on all components otherwise props are visible in soyrcecode viewer.

* Fine tuned Button and CheckboxItem stories

This migrates the Expo SDK umbrella package to TypeScript. The individual modules (that is, dependencies) have not been migrated to TypeScript. The TypeScript is compiled to JS, which is published to npm along with the original TypeScript files. This preserves compatibility with non-TypeScript-aware build pipelines.

Unit tests pass locally and in CI.

There are still several loose ends:

- ts-lint has some rough edges till we upgrade to Babel 7
- Several ts-ignore comments, especially around module exporting. We need to decide a consistent way to write imports/exports.
- Need to figure out how to do lazy imports (not dynamic imports, just lazy evaluation)
- Types look like ""any"" to the outside world because of the lazy requires we currently have. It might take a couple more SDK cycles till TS is ready to expose to developers.

Also need to update the docs for Facebook Ads and AR, both of which had API changes because of this

We replaced the underlying AST extractor from babel to typescript. This
makes the extractor a lot more future-proof due to babel having to
constantly include new plugin/syntax while TS just works out of the box.
Future new syntax would just be TS upgrade.

BREAKING CHANGE: Remove `--messages-dir` option. This was primarily used
to eagerly write out output in the babel plugin since we don't know when
the execution will be done. This is not the case with the CLI.
`--out-file` should be used instead.

includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

* flag importance of plugin order for prism-js vs embed-snippet (#5313)

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

Then, need a screenshot of the final result without <p> tags!

* flag importance of plugin order for prism-js vs embed-snippet (#5313)

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

- if provided --cert-file and --key-file paths are not real files, node gives a rejection

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

* flag importance of plugin order for prism-js vs embed-snippet (#5313)

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components (#5315)

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

- if provided --cert-file and --key-file paths are not real files, node gives a rejection

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* change link of `gatsby-advanced-blog` in docs

* Remove outdated contributing notes from gatsby-remark-prismjs

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

On mobile, the masthead is overlapping with the Gatsby icon.

* Update CONTRIBUTING.md

* pre-inferring data sanitazation (#5050)

* extractFieldExamples: omit not defined fields

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

* Typo

* added develop command options to use custom key and certs

* fixed typos in doc

* added condition to make sure both --key-file and --cert-file are present

* - passing https flag results in automatic https certs [devcert]
- --cert-file, --key-file, and --https flags can be used together for custom ssl
- if all flags needed for custom ssl are not present an error is displayed to the user
- if provided --cert-file and --key-file paths are not real files, node gives a rejection
- modified docs to express current behavior

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

Thanks for creating Gatsby and for all of your hard work! We’ve enjoyed building our new marketing website with it.

* change link of `gatsby-advanced-blog` in docs

* Remove outdated contributing notes from gatsby-remark-prismjs

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

On mobile, the masthead is overlapping with the Gatsby icon.

* Update CONTRIBUTING.md

* Add better-queue to dependencies

* Remove index.js for more consistent paths

* removing ""a""

* pre-inferring data sanitazation (#5050)

* extractFieldExamples: omit not defined fields

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

versions"" will always be building for them.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

* flag importance of plugin order for prism-js vs embed-snippet (#5313)

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

* Expand docs for custom components

The docs for custom components only mention defining custom components in the markdown, but don't address one of the most useful aspects - that you can map generic markdown tags/elements to your own components. I've expanded the docs to point this out and added a simple example.

* only look for files when looking for depracated APIs (#5374)

`glob.sync` returns files and directories by default.
It is not forbidden to name a directory `foo.js` and it would be returned by `glob`.
That's an issue because `fs.readFileSync(file)` will then fail with `EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory`.

This makes sure that `glob.sync` only returns files

* [v2] Make default browserslist more futureproof

This is inspired by Jamie Kyle's blog post/issue in babel yesterday
on the problems of using ""last 2 versions"" with @babel/preset-env which
includes browsers which aren't receiving updates anymore so ""last 2
versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

versions"" will always be building for them.

To quote his post:

>Using market share percentages as your baseline is much better than some arbitrary number of previous versions. If a browser is used by 0 people, then market percentages will reflect that.

* Typo: Return to wrong file

I was doing the gatsby.js tutorial and I was running into one issue, the tutorial said to return to index.js, but it should be to my-files.js, I eventually figured out that this was probably just a typo, but for a long time I kept changing my index.js file and didn't understand what I was doing wrong, turns out I was editing the wrong file. For so far I have enjoyed gatsby.js, I want to use it for my personal portfolio.

* Fix distance between masthead and the icon (#5068)

On mobile, the masthead is overlapping with the Gatsby icon.

* Update CONTRIBUTING.md

* pre-inferring data sanitazation (#5050)

* extractFieldExamples: omit not defined fields

this is especially helpful with ___NODE fields - plugins/users don't have to test if there are any values and be confident that empty ___NODE values or arrays will just be omitted and not error out during bootstrap

* sanitize field owner key when using createNodeField with name containing ___NODE

this fixes issue with inferring fieldOwners types - gatsby would try to link to not existing nodes

* fix(gatsby): remove `.js` suffixes in require() to allow transpilation (#5087)

In earlier v1, one could write files such as `gatsby-config` in typescript and
use babel to transpile the file into js on the fly via
`babel-node --presets @babel/preset-typescript --extensions '.ts' gatsby
develop`. However, it's no longer possible in recent releases.

The reason is that the current implementation put a `.js` suffix on each
require(`gatsby-${env}.js`), which blocks `gatsby-{$env}` files being transpiled
from other languages via babel. The PR addresses this problem by removing the
unnecessary suffix and preserving the integrity.

* I guess I found the wrong word... (#5088)

I think line 308's `src/pages/my-files.js` is wrong.
It should be `src/pages/index.js` isn't it?

* Add two missing spaces (minor validation error) (#5150)

My previous commit missed adding a space after the backup blank `src=""""` and `alt=""""` attributes. This causes an HTML validation error when no `alt` value is supplied.

This commit simply adds those missing spaces (i.e. `src="""" ` and `alt="""" `) so there will always be a space between attributes.

If gatsby-remark-prism-js is declared before gatsby-remark-embed-snippet, the latter will not pick up the `embed:example.js` syntax because it is looking for an inline-code node and it will have been transformed into a p node by gatsby-remark-prism-js. This needs to be noted as this is far from obvious.

After running into multiple bugs having to deal with whether typescript was precompiling the same way that the babel version was (some include: jest testing, repl loading, mjs support) I realized that the big issue is that razzle had figured out solutions for each env based on webpack, so instead of having the added complexity of not knowing if I had proper typescript parody, I figured just remove that layer and use typescript for the one thing I wanted: type checking.

Happy to go into detail on those bugs, but I think the main point is this approach seems a better DX experiance out of the box, while offering more heavy solutions as comments.

- to Jest's describe/test from mocha's describe/it

The majority of the mechanical changes to tests are achieved through running jest-codemods. The only two note-worthy manual tweaks:
1. Setting a testURL of http://localhost in jest config and adjusting a few tests to leverage this value instead of relying on about:blank.
2. Re-enabling ExploreChartPanel_spec which was previously commented out as we cannot have empty tests with nothing in it with Jest. :)

* Fixing lint errors. The diff looks large but is large done through `yarn run lint --fix`

The only noteworthy change is the one in eslintrc for tests. The env has been updated from mocha to jest.

* Adding eslint-plugin-jest and further modify tests.

- One small fix in sqllab's Timer Spec for a test that is not using the spy it created for testing.
- Deletion of a duplicated test caught by eslint-plugin-jest.

* Enable shared code between /web and /server

Until now, we've been able to share types from /common to both our
/server and /web codebases. However, importing any code into /server
from /common that wasn't stripped out by TypeScript (so, anything but
types), caused our directory structure to change. It broke the build
in a non-obvious way, and has been a frustrating limitation.

I've slowly and surely been upgrading our Webpack / TypeScript
dependencies, which was part of the puzzle.

This commit turns our /common directory into a proper standalone module,
with a single generated index.ts file, a build step, and type
annotations.

For consistency, we now rely on [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) on both the /web and /server packages. Treating /common as a standalone module has encapsulation benefits, and will let us manage a separate dependency list, build steps, etc. for /common.

In the process of doing this work I realized that we have a lot of (near) options for solving this task. Here are a few off the top of my head:

- Yarn Workspaces
- Yarn / NPM Private Packages
- Yarn link
- ""file: ../"" dependencies
- TypeScript Project References
- TypeScript Internal Modules
- TypeScript Path Aliases
- TypeScript Path Mapping (different thing)
- Lerna
- Oh… have I not even mentioned webpack yet?

We already using some of these, which made the task frustrating. The goal is to pick a subset that works for us, and strictly stick to that subset.

This commit also adds some trivial `real code` imports into /server,
so we can test it out right away.

For quick checks, I found the following adequate:

`cd server && tsc -b && cd ../web && yarn build`

or,

`cd server && yarn start` (tests whether node / commonjs imports are
finding /common imports)

or,

`cd common && tsc`

To run a final test of this change, I wanted to be sure that things would work
from scratch. The test plan below is a bit overkill, and it will take a while,
but it was worth the peace of mind.

docker ps -a
# docker kill/rm related processes

* fix: add @ngtools/webpack to project deps only if
@angular-devkit/build-angular is not a dependency

Revert to adding @ngtools/webpack instead of
@angular-devkit/build-angular because the later is ~150mb bigger and
slows down the {N} cloud builds.
Add @ngtools/webpack to the project dependencies only if
@angular-devkit/build-angular isn't there already. That's because the
@angular-devkit/build-angular already depends on @ngtools/webpack. This will prevent the
plugin from adding multiple instances of @ngtools/webpack to the project
which would cause the build to fail.

related to https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-dev-webpack/pull/571, https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-dev-webpack/issues/569

BREAKING CHANGES

Not really a breaking change but:
It's a good idea to remove the `@angular-devkit/build-angular` from the
package.json and add `@ngtools/webpack` instead as this will speed up

* Fixed the prev state and params in the redux router state getting set to the current state and params by changing the way that the STATE_CHANGE_SUCCESS handler in the middleware accesses the previous state and params.

* Add `href` property to the router state object

Adding `href` to the router state object gives access to the

* Update licenser test

Include `href` payload key in tests

* Fix tests and lint (#70)

* Fix tests for `onStart` and `onError`

Adds a stub for the new options param added in commit

This branch removes most of the core necessity of react-router and a router in general.

This leaves the user to implement whatever `Link`ing approachthey want, so long as it uses `history.push/replaceState` under the hood (every react router does this ;)

We are going to still recommend people use Reach Router, which will be the router we use in all of our examples as well. (We need to migrate away from React-Router for all of the examples.

From the changelog:
- All `render` and `component` props are now deprecated in favor of using `child-as-a-function` rendering. Anywhere you are using these props must be migrated to use a child as a function.
- The `Loading` component has been removed. If you wish to show loading states in your app, you can use the `Loading` props for any components that support them. This is in preparation for React...Suspense!
- React-Static no longer ships with any routing-related functionality. It functions independently of your routing paradigm. Thus, it no longer exports anything from `react-router`.
- The `PrefetchWhenSeen` component has been deprecated in favor of only using the `Prefetch` component
- The `Prefetch` component is now smart like `PrefetchWhenSeen` was.
- The client-side `Redirect` component has been deprecated. Redirects should be done in the `static.config.js`. If the user needs to do any redirects for dynamic/runtime routes, they can use their favorite router's redirect solution.
- `Router` has been deprecated and replaced by the `Root` component. The `Root` component implements the `HashScroller` component, an `ErrorBoundary` and a very simple and non-invasive route context using `@reach/router` (the recommended router). The base router is customizable or replaceable if the user wishes to use a different router.",@reach/router react,"

Summary:

This is the first step in an effort to convert javascript SDK from Common JS to ES Module. The changes include
1. Convert all the entry point files to ES Module.
2. Minified Common JS bundles are being created for each entry point using Rollup and Terser
main: dist/optimizely.node.min.js
browser: dist/optimizely.browser.min.js
react-native: dist/optimizely.react_native.min.js
3. All the bundles including umd bundle are generated using Rollup and terser. Webpack is only being used to keep the Karma tests running.

Why Webpack for Karma?

We tried using Rollup with Karma for the same purpose but couldnt run it despite trying many times. To not block progress on the ES module conversion, we recommend moving forward with using webpack to keep running karma tests when all the bundles are being created by Rollup and terser. We can revisit and modify Karma to use Rollup later. 

Note about Testapp:

This PR uses a specific branch of javascript-testapp. This change is required because now testapp has to run an additional command to build the bundles which was not the case earlier. This testapp PR needs to be merged before merging this SDK branch.
https://github.com/optimizely/javascript-testapp/pull/83

Test plan:
All unit tests and Full stack compatibility suite tests pass.

This commit brings the following updates:

- Removal of the following redundant or unused packages:

  - `json-loader`: Webpack 2 can handle JSON files by default;
  - `copy-webpack-plugin`: unused;
  - `webpack-dev-server`: unused.

- Upgrade of the following packages to their latest versions:

  - `fs-extra`;
  - `webpack`: upgraded to the latest stable version;
  - `webpack-shell-plugin`.

- Addition of the following packages:

  - `uuid`, in replacement of the deprecated `node-uuid`, with no
    changes to the public API.

  - `eslint`, with ESLint linting utility.

- Addition of two runnable scripts to help development tasks:

  - `build`: An alias for running `webpack`.
  - `eslint`: Alias for running ESLint using the provided configuration
    in the project.

- Fix the package entry point, so package consumers will be capable to use

- Rationale:
  - Pux is simpler in some aspects (overall flow, handling of effects)
    and has better documentation for beginners, but isn't even up to
    date with the latest PureScript and has a harder to approach
    syntax for both the DOM and CSS than Halogen.
  - Halogen is more production ready, has OK documentation (not ideal
    for beginners), has a straightforward DOM syntax, and can have
    separate CSS files, which makes it easier to focus on other
    things. Things that are more complicated to explain: how state
    updates work, some of the types or type errors, querying and
    receiving events from outside of a component, sub-components.
  - psc-package replaces Bower here mainly because people don't like
    to see Bower right away and wonder about e.g. it being deprecated.",react preact,"Replace Pux with Halogen and Bower with psc-package

This results in a pretty decent size decrease just from the move and
making use of babel-preset-env's useBuiltIns option (240K -> 230K on the
web, and 880K -> 680K on the game JS, not sure about the app JS but
probably similar).

In making this change I noticed that babel was using .babelrc's from the
folders (or ancestor folders) of the JS files being transpiled, which
was unexpected for things like common/. I've changed the repo to only
have 2 babelrc's (one so that it actually gets built into our electron
app, and one at the root, but these files should always match exactly).
For builds that are specific to some client that we don't run from this
directory (e.g. webpack builds), we explicitly disable babelrc usage and
write the options in the webpack configs.

Things feel a bit more performant in the compiled JS too, although I may
just be hallucinating that.",babel json-loader,"Move to Webpack 2.

## Description

This PR combines three others (#1273, #1280, #1291) and rewrites Gesture Handler and examples to TS.
We tried to make non-breaking changes but this should be tested.

Most types were overhauled, although they should remain compatible with old ones thanks to the type aliases in the `src/handlers/gestureHandlerTypesCompat.ts` file.

CI for iOS was disabled due to strange fails. It should be reenabled when we add unit/e2e tests to RNGH.

Fixes #1076 - removed Flow from DrawerLayout
Fixes #1261 - added TS types
Fixes #998 - regenerated example app
Fixes #887 - removed prop types

## Changes

### Package packing, configs & source code

- Swipeable and DrawerLayout are now resolved by their own `package.json`s
- React Native uses source code directly, browser and TS use files from `dist/`
- Removed prop types

#### Internal

- Removed unused babel config in the root dir, adjust Eslint config
- Removed unused functions
- Changed private names from `_name` to `private name`
- Replaced `x && x()` syntax with `x.?()`

### Types

- Added types compatibility layer for the new types (`gestureHandlerTypesCompat.ts`)
- Added generation of declarations and declarations map when TS is transpiled
- Moved types from declaration files to files with implementation
- Added types to Android / iOS / shared JS code
- Added basic types to the web version

### Example app

- Removed unused bits in examples
- Regenerated Example app with latest RN
- Removed stray files from examples/
- Updated Travis config to include newer Android build tools & iOS scheme name change
- Organized Example code structure
- Removed Example tests (they weren't testing anything)
- Reconfigured web version of examples

## Testing

PRs that were merged into `ts-rewrite` branch were tested by using `npm pack` and adding it to the new app. In the case of #1273 & #1280, we additionally checked bundled diff for changes.

We diffed master to generated dist/ directory using `diff --color -wryN -W 200 src/ dist/src`with imports removed by `find src -name ""*.js"" -type f -exec sed -i '' '/import/d' {} \;`
