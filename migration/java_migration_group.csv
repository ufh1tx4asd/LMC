- The gclib dependency in the EnchancerFactory has been removed. All classes that used the actual factory part of it have been updated to use bytebuddy instead. This class will have to be removed at some point, but at the moment it is still used for accessing its class loader.
- Renamed EnhancerFactory to ByteBuddyFactory. All ByteBuddy actions should go through this now. Every subclass created here implements the ByteBuddyGenerated interface. This makes it possible to recognize classes generated using ByteBuddy (by default, it doesn't leave such a trace).
- Removed the method DefaultInstances#forEnhancer(Enhancer). This method isn't used anywhere; the last trace of usage of the method I could find was in 2013 (in the NetworkServerInjector). External plugins (I couldn't find any that used it), they should really have their own implementation, given that they already require an instance of an Enchancer. As such, I feel it is safe to remove rather than update it.",net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy cglib:cglib,"

There will be more changes in this module in separate check-ins.

- Extracted the local underfs module from core and moved it to a new module in 'tachyon-underfs', called 'tachyon-underfs-local'. Introduced a new unit test for this module (LocalUnderFileSystemTest.java), which checks for the presence of the local under file system. Also moved corresponding META-INF files from core module.

- Appropriately moved the under file system unit tests to 'tachyon-common' module. Updated the UnderFileSystemTest.java to not check for local under file system anymore, because it is not a part of tachyon-common package. (It is a separate module now as mentioned above.)

- Moved various clients' unit tests from core module to their respective modules.

- Introduced log4j.properties files for tachyon-client, tachyon-hadoop, tachyon-shell and tachyon-underfs-local modules.

- Appropriate updates to various pom.xml files to resolve dependencies and remove unnecessary dependencies.

- Updated 'clients/client/src/main/java/tachyon/client/table/RawColumn.java' to address some merge conflicts.

Fix #1514 Update pom.xml with log4j2 dependencies

* Use slf4j bindings for log4j2
* Keep log4j 1.2 jars for minicluster and test, because ZK needs it at runtime
* Use log4j-1.2-api jar for log4j 1.2 dependencies for deprecated public
  APIs that can't yet be removed (particularly in core/mapred stuffs)
* Add disruptor jar to class path to support high-performance asynchronous loggers
* Exclude transitive dependencies for log4j 1.2, for better control over
  build class path, and to avoid multiple runtime slf4j bindings
* Update assembly to include log4j2 jars, and to exclude log4j 1.2 jars

Fix #1515 Create new AccumuloMonitorAppender to send to REST endpoint

* Remove unnecessary extra port configuration property for log4j
  SocketServer endpoint in monitor
* Update Monitor to store HTTP(s) URL for the service in ZK instead of
  just host and port; remove redundant log4j service advertisement using
  old log4j SocketServer port
* Create new AccumuloMonitorAppender to read HTTP(s) URL from ZooCache,
  on demand, and send logs as JSON to the REST endpoint at that URL
* Fix extra slash in MonitorUtilTest
* Replace previous LogService in monitor with simpler RecentLogs
  implementation to cache received logs from REST endpoint
* Simplify LogResource REST endpoints to use the RecentLogs APIs, with
  new endpoint to receive POSTed logs as JSON, and clean up the
  deduplication/counting/sanitizing code
* Simplify StatusResource to get its info from the RecentLogs object
* Update the web views to include logger names on the monitor page, and
  to simplify passing of the optional stacktrace details

Fix #1516 Remove log4j1 config files and add log4j2 config files

* Create basic log4j2 config files for Accumulo services and a default
  config file for clients such as the shell
* Update accumulo-env.sh to configure logging using high-performance
  asynchronous loggers
* Create service config file with console, rolling file, and monitor
  appenders, as well as an example separate rolling file appender for
  audit logs that can be easily toggled on
* Create config file for console suitable for clients, especially the
  shell, complete with color highlighting
* Add config for periodic auto-reconfiguring of log4j without restarting
  services (especially helpful as a substitute for the now defunct shell
  option for 'debug on')

* Fix ITs and make log clearing use a dedicated endpoint

Fix #1529 Migrate log4j 1.2 test files to log4j2

* Fix AuditMessageIT and directly convert existing log4j 1.2 configuration
  files to log4j2 format. No evaluation was done to update the files, only
  direct conversion from previous behavior.",org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j org.slf4j:slf4j,"

    - common settings can be <include>d from files, esp those in core/src/main/resources/brooklyn/
    - logging for tests is automatic (using test-support/src/main/resources/logback-tests.xml)
    - your own logback.xml can just be one line -- see e.g. usage/launcher/src/main/resources/logback.xml
    - if you don't have a logback, default is lots of logging, not none or errors

    you can set a specific logback config file to use with:

        -Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml

    in eclipse you may have to update the maven project.  and if you're not getting the logging you expect in the IDE,
    make sure src/main/resources is included (in eclipse, right-click the project, the Build Path -> Configure,
    then make sure all dirs are included (All) and excluded (None) -- mvn clean install should do this for you btw);

Changes:

* Replace Jersey dependency (JAX-RS 1.1) implementation with CXF (JAX-RS 2.0)
* Use relative paths for REST resource paths

Move the context root at /v1, and use paths relative to that in resource
annotations.

* Add CXF REST resources to karaf features
* Remove /v1 prefix from brooklyn-rest-api resources
* Move CXF servlet context to /v1

In order to preserve compatibility with the existing brooklyn REST API
we need to expose resources at path /v1 instead of /cxf/v1.

For now move the whole CXF servlet at /v1, and with resources mounted at
/ we get the historical path /v1/ for the REST API. We'll need to make
the JSGUI configurable with the base REST API path in the future though.

Also add appropriate providers to the OSGi CXF service blueprint.

* Use relative paths when referring REST resources

Don't use absolute paths based on the assumption that the REST API is
deployed at /v1.

Instead use an UriBuilder provided by JAX-RS as a context-injected
UriInfo object, which should work with any root context path.

Also drop the /v1 prefix from REST API tests and test fixtures.

* Fix usage of resources in CXF unit tests

Use HTTP transport instead of local transport so we can have a ServletContext to get/setAttribute.
Allow CXF to use BrooklynJacksonJsonProvider for message formatting and parsing.
Inject the ManagementContext in resources and providers.
Add request/response logging during tests.

* Pull up common implementation of configureCXF

All tests ended up using the same configuration of the REST API, so it
makes sense to move that into the base class

This had the side effect of worsening the interleaving of test methods
by testng, so each resource test was separated into its own suite.

* Fix DeployBlueprintTest

Also change getEndpointAddress() to use template method instead of
setter/getter.

* Wait for CXF resources to start in karaf itest

* Remove CatalogApi's multipart/form-data create method

There is no standard JAX-RS way to process multipart/form-data contents,
so this service was removed from the API for the purpose of unifying the

Changes:

* Replace Jersey dependency (JAX-RS 1.1) implementation with CXF (JAX-RS 2.0)
* Use relative paths for REST resource paths

Move the context root at /v1, and use paths relative to that in resource
annotations.

* Add CXF REST resources to karaf features
* Remove /v1 prefix from brooklyn-rest-api resources
* Move CXF servlet context to /v1

In order to preserve compatibility with the existing brooklyn REST API
we need to expose resources at path /v1 instead of /cxf/v1.

For now move the whole CXF servlet at /v1, and with resources mounted at
/ we get the historical path /v1/ for the REST API. We'll need to make
the JSGUI configurable with the base REST API path in the future though.

Also add appropriate providers to the OSGi CXF service blueprint.

* Use relative paths when referring REST resources

Don't use absolute paths based on the assumption that the REST API is
deployed at /v1.

Instead use an UriBuilder provided by JAX-RS as a context-injected
UriInfo object, which should work with any root context path.

Also drop the /v1 prefix from REST API tests and test fixtures.

* Fix usage of resources in CXF unit tests

Use HTTP transport instead of local transport so we can have a ServletContext to get/setAttribute.
Allow CXF to use BrooklynJacksonJsonProvider for message formatting and parsing.
Inject the ManagementContext in resources and providers.
Add request/response logging during tests.

* Pull up common implementation of configureCXF

All tests ended up using the same configuration of the REST API, so it
makes sense to move that into the base class

This had the side effect of worsening the interleaving of test methods
by testng, so each resource test was separated into its own suite.

* Fix DeployBlueprintTest

Also change getEndpointAddress() to use template method instead of
setter/getter.

* Wait for CXF resources to start in karaf itest

* Remove CatalogApi's multipart/form-data create method

There is no standard JAX-RS way to process multipart/form-data contents,
so this service was removed from the API for the purpose of unifying the

* CSV-252 Stop using junit.framework.TestCase

junit.framework.TestCase is a class from JUnit 3, and while it is not
officially deprecated, it's discouraged to use it.

This patch removes the single use of
junit.framework.TestCase#assertNull, and replaces it with the
standard, recommended, org.junit.Assert#assertNull.

* CSV-252 Standardize org.junit.Assert imports

Code in the project uses org.junit.Assert's methods in two ways:
1. By statically importing them
2. By importing the class and using its methods

Option 1 seems to be the de-facto standard, with just a handful of
cases using Option 2.
This patch standardizes these cases to also use static imports thus
making the code look more uniform, and easier to maintain.

* CSV-252 Upgrade Mockito to 3.1.0

Upgrade the Mockito dependency to the latest available version, 3.1.0,
in order to facilitate an upgrade to JUnit Jupiter.

* CSV-252 JUnit Jupiter upgrade

This patch upgrades the project's testing framework from JUnit 4.12
to the modern JUnit Jupiter 5.5.4.

Since JUnit 5 Jupiter is not backwards compatible to JUnit 4.x (or
even JUnit Vintage), this patch is a bit large, even though a lot of
the changes are merely cosmetic (such as changing the argument order,
see details below). In order to make the reviewer's task as easy as
possible, this PR does not presume to use JUnit Jupiter's best
practices and all its new functionality, but only to migrate the
existing tests with as little change as possible. Following patches
may want to improve the tests by using some of JUnit Jupiter's new
features.

This patch includes the following changes:

1. Maven dependency changes:
 a. junit:junit was replaced with org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter.
 b. org.hamcrest:hamcrest was introduced as an explicit dependency,
    since the project uses Hamcrest, and JUnit Jupiter does not
    bundle Hamcrest, unlike JUnit 4.x.

2. Annotations:
 a. org.junit.jupiter.api.Test was used as a drop in replacement for
    org.juit.Test without arguments. See 3.ii. for handling of @Test
    annotations with an ""expected"" argument.
 b. org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach was used as an drop in
    replacement for org.junit.Before.
 c. org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll was used as an drop in
    replacement for org.junit.BeforeClass.
 d. org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled was used as a drop in replacement
    for org.junit.Ignore.

3. Assertions:
 a. org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions' methods were used as drop in
    replacements for org.junit.Assert's methods with the same name in
    the simple case of an assertion without a message. In the case of
    an assertion with a message, org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions'
    methods were used, but the argument order was changed - Assert's
    methods take the message as the first argument, while Assertions'
    methods take the message as the last argument.
 b. org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions#assertThrows was used to assert
    that a specific exception was throws instead of an org.junit.Test
    annotation with an expected argument. This technique has a couple
    of side bonuses. First, it makes the tests slightly stricter, as
    now they can assert the exception was thrown from a specific line
    and prevent false positives where the test's ""set-up"" code
    accidentally threw that exception. Second, it clarifies that some
    of the test code is unreachable (as a previous line already
    throws an exception), and can safely be removed in order to clean
    up the test. The throws clauses of these methods were cleaned up
    from exceptions that can no longer be thrown in order to avoid
    compilation warnings.
 c. org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert#assertThat was used as a drop in
    replacement for org.junit.Assert#assertThat.

4. Specific Changes:
 a. CSVFileParserTest was rewritten with JUnit Jupiter's
    org.junit.jupiter.api.ParameterizedTest. Unlike JUnit 4's
    org.junit.runners.Parameterized, it cannot be used to inject
    arguments to a test's construct, and so the test can't be
    stateful. Instead, it was rewritten so every test receives the
    file as a parameter, and opens a reader on it itself. As a side
    bonus, this design makes it easier to close the reader and avoid
    leaving open file descriptors like the original test did.",org.mockito:mockito junit:junit,"

* DRILL-7941 Update JUnit from 4.13.2 to 5.7.2

* DRILL-7941 Add dependency management for JUnit 4.x

This way we can control the version used by junit-vintage-engine and most importantly its scope (test).

Now the dependency:tree looks like:

[INFO] +- org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine:jar:5.7.2:test
[INFO] |  +- org.apiguardian:apiguardian-api:jar:1.1.0:test
[INFO] |  +- org.junit.platform:junit-platform-engine:jar:1.7.2:test
[INFO] |  |  +- org.opentest4j:opentest4j:jar:1.2.0:test
[INFO] |  |  \- org.junit.platform:junit-platform-commons:jar:1.7.2:test
[INFO] |  \- junit:junit:jar:4.13.2:test

Before this change the scope of junit:junit was 'compile' and its version - 4.13
The compile scope added to the total size of java-exec-all.jar and maven-enforcer rule failed

* DRILL-7941 Add junit:junit with 'provided' scope to drill-common for RepeatTestRule

Remove an obsolete comment from drill-logical/pom.xml

* DRILL-7941 Migrate few unit tests from JUnit 4.x APIs to 5.x APIs

* DRILL-7941 Move RepeatTestRule to drill-common/src/test

This way there is no need to have dependency to junit:junit in the main sources

suggested-by: vvysotskyi

* DRILL-7941 Use junit-bom to manage the dependencies

Use junit-jupiter library. It brings -api, -engine and -params as transitive dependencies, so the full power of JUnit 5.x could be easily used.

* DRILL-7941 Add junit-jupiter and junit-vintage-engine as dependencies in the root module

This way both are available for all sub-modules.

so it's pretty much a drop-in replacement, but with some big advantages:

    - common settings can be <include>d from files, esp those in core/src/main/resources/brooklyn/
    - logging for tests is automatic (using test-support/src/main/resources/logback-tests.xml)
    - your own logback.xml can just be one line -- see e.g. usage/launcher/src/main/resources/logback.xml
    - if you don't have a logback, default is lots of logging, not none or errors

    you can set a specific logback config file to use with:

        -Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml

    in eclipse you may have to update the maven project.  and if you're not getting the logging you expect in the IDE,
    make sure src/main/resources is included (in eclipse, right-click the project, the Build Path -> Configure,
    then make sure all dirs are included (All) and excluded (None) -- mvn clean install should do this for you btw);

    FYI you might find that the IDE logs to a file brooklyn-tests.log because it doesn't distinguish between test builds.

Fixes #5215  #4601 #5215

### Motivation

Right now, the number of supported JDBC connectors is rather limited. There are a couple of open issues related to the missing connectors. 

### Modifications

As a base for this pull request, I took the [changes](https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/5624) from @huangdx0726 Unfortunately,  I was not able to reach him to merge my changes to his branch, so I created a new one.

The main modification is a split of one JDBC module into a bunch of them. One module serves as a core and provides the main logic of the connector. Other modules are real connectors and add only an appropriate JDBC driver.",org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client mysql:mysql-connector-java,"[Issue 5215,4601,5215][pulsar-io] Add jdbc sinks: postgres, mariadb, clickhouse (#6835)

1) Refactored depedencies for unit-test-related jars to parent pom.  Added test scope to depedencies.

4) Added a couple of new tests.

I have a made a pretty thorough sweep through the entire pom tree and have brought just about everything up to date in all poms - I don't think there is one that has not been touched!

All dependencies are looking good, and several erroneous dependencies that had crept in have been squeezed back out.

Where possible I have pulled up dependency management into parent poms (where they should be) - All examples remain as standalone modules. This will encourage global version definition, rather than the current array of varying versions across the tree - The next step will be to define 'all' versions as properties (at the moment only several are defined). A further goal is to update the maven-assembly-plugin to a more current version, but this will need more reading up on my part to figure out what is required.

I have also updated a few classes in Axis2 in order to use 1.4.1 - A move to 1.5.2 will also require more work. Do we need to maintain backwards compatibility on this dependency?

The following two tests fail intermittently on:

assertAttribute(""Aged"", 5L);

org.apache.openejb.core.stateless.StatelessPoolStatsTest.testAging()
org.apache.openejb.core.stateless.StatelessPoolStatsTest.testAgingWithReplacement()

This has to be some kind of synchronization or timing issue that returns inconsistent results - I have seen 'Aged' vary between 3L - 8L.


-----------
Also, I am not sure if this is a maven quirk (or an Andy on Windows quirk) but when the core fails at least one test then the core classes directory gets a file lock and the assembly plugin cannot create several assemblies even when -fn or -fae are specified?

Running:

mvn -e -fn -Dassemble clean install

Followed by:

mvn -e -fn -DskipTests -Dassemble

Results in a successful build

To reiterate, if I comment out the above two tests then a clean build succeeds.

Finally to sum up. I have compared the build 'lib' directory with a previous build and I am pretty sure that the new build has dropped only erroneous dependencies. However, if you find a jar missing that you believe should be an included dependency then please let me know.

If you have any problems then try the following:

mvn dependency:purge-local-repository
mvn -e -U -fn -Dassemble clean install
mvn -e -fn -DskipTests -Dassemble

This removes the Log implementation based on java.util.logging and
replaces it with SLF4J. The compiler removal of debug log messages still
works because Log.DEBUG and similar final constants are unchanged.

This commit adds slf4j-simple as the test logger implementation.
Configuration for slf4j-simple is in the root pom. Two modules can't use
slf4j-simple, parquet-pig and parquet-thrift, and use slf4j-log4j12
instead because pig depends on log4j and tests die without it.

Note that the DBLP Indexer does no longer contain any source code. It defines only the default configuration and the pom.xml to build (and assembly) the indexing Utility.
By calling the utility with the command ""init"" the configuration will be initialised with the defaults (see the README.txt for details).

other Changes:

SolrYard:
 - has now support for the Solr commitWithin feature: This allows to tell solr the maximum duration until changes to the index need to be committed. This feature is very nice for indexing, because it reduces the number of commits.
 - added a public close() method to the SolrYard to allow the deactivation of a SolrYard outside an OSGI environment.
 
The SolrYard IndexingDestination now uses the new features of the SolrYard

Indexing Core:
Added two very simple EntityScoreProvider. The first one simple returns null as score and is intended to be used if no scores are available. The second can be configured to return the same score for all entities (default is 1).

Parent POM:
 - added all Entityhub Indexing bundles
 - added SLF4J Bundles for log4j and the log4j bundle

### other changes

* replaced most of the remaining ""jsr311-api"" dependencies with ""jersey.core"". Some are still left because -Pkres does currently not build
* changed all remaining JSON code that used libs other than ""jettison"" to use jettison

I have a made a pretty thorough sweep through the entire pom tree and have brought just about everything up to date in all poms - I don't think there is one that has not been touched!

All dependencies are looking good, and several erroneous dependencies that had crept in have been squeezed back out.

Where possible I have pulled up dependency management into parent poms (where they should be) - All examples remain as standalone modules. This will encourage global version definition, rather than the current array of varying versions across the tree - The next step will be to define 'all' versions as properties (at the moment only several are defined). A further goal is to update the maven-assembly-plugin to a more current version, but this will need more reading up on my part to figure out what is required.

I have also updated a few classes in Axis2 in order to use 1.4.1 - A move to 1.5.2 will also require more work. Do we need to maintain backwards compatibility on this dependency?

The following two tests fail intermittently on:

assertAttribute(""Aged"", 5L);

org.apache.openejb.core.stateless.StatelessPoolStatsTest.testAging()
org.apache.openejb.core.stateless.StatelessPoolStatsTest.testAgingWithReplacement()

This has to be some kind of synchronization or timing issue that returns inconsistent results - I have seen 'Aged' vary between 3L - 8L.


-----------
Also, I am not sure if this is a maven quirk (or an Andy on Windows quirk) but when the core fails at least one test then the core classes directory gets a file lock and the assembly plugin cannot create several assemblies even when -fn or -fae are specified?

Running:

mvn -e -fn -Dassemble clean install

Followed by:

mvn -e -fn -DskipTests -Dassemble

Results in a successful build

To reiterate, if I comment out the above two tests then a clean build succeeds.

Finally to sum up. I have compared the build 'lib' directory with a previous build and I am pretty sure that the new build has dropped only erroneous dependencies. However, if you find a jar missing that you believe should be an included dependency then please let me know.

If you have any problems then try the following:

mvn dependency:purge-local-repository
mvn -e -U -fn -Dassemble clean install
mvn -e -fn -DskipTests -Dassemble

* Sampler tree (#56)

changes

* Cleanup of State and ser/de test (#60)

This is a change to CompactRCF branch. Moves the construction of state into the forest class. Updates ser/de tests to reflect that.

* convertor to compact + compression (#61)

* Changing both samplers to use floats for weights (#63)

* Add new interfaces and classes for mapping between models and states

* Modify the forest constructor to create a list of component models (#65)

This is a first step toward removing state from executor classes.
Eventually all state should be owned by the forest, the update
coordinator, or the component models. This change modifies the forest
constructor to initialize component models, but those models are not yet
in the execution path.

* Update executors to use ComponentList (#66)

Update the executor classes to operate on the generic ComponentList
class instead of a list of SamplerPlusTree.

* Implement forest deserialization in RandomCutForestMapper (#67)

Complete the updated serialiazation implemenation using
IConextualStateMapper for the RandomCutForest class.

* Compact rcf (#69)

Create the INodeView interface to decouple visitors from the concrete Node class

* Add benchmark class for serialization

* Add INodeView implementation for compact trees (#71)

Add INodeView implementation for compact trees and change the delete method to be more efficient.

* Optimizations for the addPoint operation in compact trees (#72)

* Compact rcf (#74)

refactor tree

* Introducing AbstractCompactRandomCutTree to enable float[] alongside double[] (#75)

* Add lombok.config to repository (#94)

Add lombok.config and set the property addLombokGeneratedAnnotation to
true. This will make it so that jacoco ignores lombok generated code
when computing test coverage.

* Add support for single and double precision in compact trees (#76)

* Fix javadoc warnings

Update javadocs in classes that were producing warnings.

Closes #89

* Improvements to sampler package

* Standardize field names in CompactSampler
* Update Javadocs
* Add ability to validate the heap property in CompactSampler
* Move common methods to the IStreamSampler interface
* Add @Data annotation to Weighted class and remove unused methods
* Improve package test coverage
* Set fields in CompactSamplerState to private

* Updates to forest/builder configuration

* Change the singlePrecisionEnabled flag to use a new Precision enum
* Remove logic from the builder that overrides user options. Instead
  we will fail fast in the constructor.

Closes #77 #82

* Remove the Sequential interface

This change makes the sequence index an explicit argument to the sampler
and tree interfaces. As a result we can remove the Sequential container
class. Other changes:

* There is a new interface ISampled that which is used in the return type
  of getSamples() and getEvictedPoint().
* The Weighted container class implements ISampled
* The signatures of acceptSample and addSample are changed to remove
  redundancy and to avoid leaking implementation details. In particular,
  acceptSample no longer returns a weight, because the use of weights is a
  feature of time-decayed sampling, but not a requirement for stream
  sampling.
* Updates to method names in IStreamSampler to more clearly reflect use.

Closes #80

* Unify pointer-based and compact trees (#103)

Create new interfaces and abstract base classes to contain common logic between the pointer-based and compact tree implementations.

* removing arbitrary nodeview (#108)

Remove the getNodeView method from the INodeView interface and add it to the abstract tree base class. Additionally, change the visibility of tree methods related to tree structure from package-private to protected.

Closes #106

* Change IUpdatable interface to not return nested Optional (#110)

Rename UpdateReturn to UpdateResult, and add a new method
isStateChange() that can be called to determine if the update changed
the model.

Closes #81

* Normalize constructors for state and mapper classes

This change makes it so that all state and mapper classes have a single
no-argument constructor and settable fields. Additionally, new test
cases are added to improve test coverage in the state package.

Closes #90

* Various changes to make mapper classes work in a consistent way

* Have samplers serialize their own lambda and sample size values
* Create a new mapper for CompactNodeManager
* Update the CompactRandomCutTreeState class to contain a node manager
  state instead of leaf and node store states
* Revert CompactNodeManager to work with ILeafStore and INodeStore
  interfaces instead of implementations
* PointStoreCoordinator returns an IPointStore instead of a concrete
  class
* Update mapper classes to respect the bounding box cache setting

Closes #115

* Fix bounding box calculation and update caching algorithm (#118)

* Fix bounding box calculation in compact trees
* Add bounding box caching to pointer-based trees

* Remove compact node manager class

In a previous revision, we introducted the CompactNodeManager class to
unify the handling of leaf nodes and internal nodes. The initial
implementation was a leaky abstraction, because the tree class was still
responsible for managing some node properties, like bounding boxes.
The change moves node management back into the tree class.

* Add support for serializing single-precision points

Closes #78 #87

* RandomCutForest mapper should keep single precision when mapping to state

* Refactor RandomCutForestSerDe

Refactor the RandomCutForestSerDe class to operate directly on
RandomCutForest objects instead of RandomCutForestState objects.
Additionally, refactor the RandomCutForestSerDe unit tests to remove
assertions that make more sense as a functional test in the core package
or as a benchmark.

* Support mapping CompactSampler to state class without copy

In addition, the copy flag is added to other applicable mapper classes,
but the behavior (mapping without copy) is only implemented for
CompactSamplerMapper in this commit.

* Split imputation into two methods and fix bounding box computation (#149)

* Split the imputation method into two methods: the first method collects the imputation proposal from each tree, and the second method uses that result to construct the point estimate. The list of proposals may be of independent interest to users, hence we are separating it into its own public API call.
* Fixed a bug in the conditional logic for constructing bounding boxes.

- Use the ""Enabled"" suffix for boolean flags where it improves
  readability.
- Use ""compressed"" in state classes versus ""isCompressionEnabled"" in
  mapper classes.
- Use ""isPartialTreeState"" in state classes versus
  ""isPartialTreeStateEnabled"" in mapper classes.
- Store precision as a String instead of a boolean.

* Change field visibility in BoxCache and NodeStore (#197)

- Lower the visibility of fields in BoxCache and NodeStore to private or
  protected
- Rename methods in the NodeStore class: change `getParentIndex` to

- Update version number to 2.0
- Make compact mode the default
- Add a placeholder ""mode"" string to RandomCutForest for forward
  compatibility.
- Change license header back to using 2020 until we decide what to do

* Create an IVisitorFactory interface (#216)

In a previous commit (#208) we added support for projections, which
added a new method to the VisitorFactory class. This change creates an
IVisitorFactory interface which is implemented VisitorFactory, giving
users the option to create specialized implementations.

Background:
The configuration objects are serialized to JSON and written to the log during startup.
Currently the behavior uses GSON. This is one of the few places where GSON is used.
In all other places we use Jackson. There is nothing special about using GSON here,
so it can and should be replaced with Jackson.

Scope
- Replace GSON with Jackson in BrokerCfg and GatewayCfg
- Factory method for JSON object writers with custom serializers for Duration (and other Java time objects)
  and DataSize objects

Out of Scope

Dependency to GSON in ExporterConfiguration - the class had a low test coverage and comparing
the default output of GSON vs. Jackson revealed that they are not identical, so changing the
serializer/deserializer here could alter behavior.",com.fasterxml.jackson com.google.code.gson:gson,"

This change is a rewrite of the auto-reconfiguration support in the Java
Buildpack.  Previously there was a quite a lot of code in the auto-
reconfiguration project that examined the internals of bean definitions and
the various ways those bean definitions might be constructed to replace
detailed portions.  The new view in 2.x is that we're going to do auto-
reconfiguration at the bean level and no lower.  This is easily the most
typical way that auto-reconfiguration was used and has the added advantage of
being attuned to how Spring Boot creates beans.

In addition to massively simplifying the code base by simply matching a bean
type and a service type and replacing one for the other, this change also
allows us to easily expand the auto-reconfiguration to the complete set of
default service types understood by Spring Cloud Connectors.  To complete the
list we've added Cassandra and SMTP support.

We've also massively simplified the test matrix for the project by adopting
Spring.io platform releases (i.e. platform-bom) as the set of compatible
versions that we will test against.  The CI system, and our planned support
starts at Athens-RELEASE (Spring Boot 1.4) and will cover every subsequent
release (e.g. Brussels-RELEASE, Cairo-RELEASE), as well as every service
release (e.g. Athens-SR6, Brussels-SR5).  This starts by chopping our test
matrix to a third of its original size (but possibly out growing it over the
long term) but giving us a much more robust combination of dependencies (since
they're the dependencies most likely to be used by customers) to test against.
It is not only possible, but likely, that auto-reconfiguration will work
further back than that (thank you Spring Data for being so compatible), but we
will not be testing against it.

Finally, this change includes the source code into a shaded source code JAR.
Note that some of the pre-shaded code from Spring Cloud Connectors is not
included in its source jar and therefore is missing.

In addition to massively simplifying the code base by simply matching a bean
type and a service type and replacing one for the other, this change also
allows us to easily expand the auto-reconfiguration to the complete set of
default service types understood by Spring Cloud Connectors.  To complete the
list we've added Cassandra and SMTP support.

We've also massively simplified the test matrix for the project by adopting
Spring.io platform releases (i.e. platform-bom) as the set of compatible
versions that we will test against.  The CI system, and our planned support
starts at Athens-RELEASE (Spring Boot 1.4) and will cover every subsequent
release (e.g. Brussels-RELEASE, Cairo-RELEASE), as well as every service
release (e.g. Athens-SR6, Brussels-SR5).  This starts by chopping our test
matrix to a third of its original size (but possibly out growing it over the
long term) but giving us a much more robust combination of dependencies (since
they're the dependencies most likely to be used by customers) to test against.
It is not only possible, but likely, that auto-reconfiguration will work
further back than that (thank you Spring Data for being so compatible), but we
will not be testing against it.

Finally, this change includes the source code into a shaded source code JAR.
Note that some of the pre-shaded code from Spring Cloud Connectors is not
included in its source jar and therefore is missing.

* LGTM fixes

A couple of small tweaks to make LGTM happy.

* Add missing Javadocs

Address some Javadoc warnings.

Also silenced warnings for Jooq code.

* Very simple RingBuffer to catch and log exceptions.

It collects all error messages and lets you manually dump them. Or, you can dump them based on a log of a given level.

* Silence profile validation logging

We don't need to log at warn, we don't really need to log at all.

* Created dpc-testing module

Created a common module for sharing testing related code.

Moved the buffered logger into the testing module.

* Renamed BufferedLoggerWatcher and added programatic config

We now configure the logger in the test setup, rather than requiring overriding of test dependencies.

* Queue and Common are now using our logger

I can't figure out how to silence Hibernate, but the rest is gone.

* Bluebutton and Macaroon modules are migrated.

* All modules are now using the BufferedLogger for testing.

Hibernate is still loud, but overall, things should be much quieter.

* Moved Integration Test annotation

Also silenced more Validator warnings (which aren't actually warnings).

* Fix Swagger warnings

Add datatype to implicit ApiParam, which removes another warning.

* Update publish box settings.

* Fix invalid imports

* Surpress Hibernate logging in tests

* Fix bad javadoc import

* Remove erroneous logback-test files

* Remove one more logback-test.xml file

The nsswitch gPlazma plugin uses JNA to access some native functions
common to various BSD-like OSes (including GNU/Linux).  It implements
the identity-, map- and session- gPlazma plugin functionality.  The
identity- and map- functionality is based on username <--> uid,
group-name <--> gid and a user's group-membership.  The session
functionality provides hard-coded behaviour (which might be better
factored out as a separate plugin).

There are several problems with the current nsswitch unit-tests:

  1. The unit-tests depend on JNA.  Not all JVMs support JNA, so can
     cause problems, especially since JNA relies on a native library,
     which is not available for all OSes.

  2. The unit-tests depend on OS/native functions.  Not all OSes
     support these functions.  While this prevents such OSes from
     using the nsswitch plugin for deployed dCache instances, it
     should not prevent developers from using such OSes.

  3. The unit-tests depend on system configuration.  While most
     Unix-like systems have a user ""root"" with uid 0 and primary gid
     0; other users and groups are not standardised --- even gid 0 can
     have different group-name (""root"" or ""wheel"")

  4. The existing tests cover only part of the identity functionality.
     The tests do not cover group--gid identity-reverse-mapping, all
     map and session functionality.

This patch addresses these issues by fully mocking the JNA-backed
classes.  That way, the unit-tests are completely isolated from JNA,
the underlying OS and its configuration.  This allows a complete
coverage of the nsswitch plugin's functionality in a portable fashion.

It turns out that mocking the JNA-based classes that nsswitch plugin
uses is particularly tricky as these Java classes inherit from system
classes that make use of static initialisers and make JNI calls from
the constructor.  Mockito-mocked classes solve points 2. to 4., but
will still require a valid JNA, so point 1. is still a problem.

To solve point 1., this patch adds the PowerMock framework.  This is
an extension to mockito that adds support for the byte-code
manipulation needed to avoid static initializer and suppress
superclass constructors.  The nsswitch unit-tests are still written
using junit and mockito; however, in addition, PowerMock is used as
required.  Note that all existing unit-tests continue to function as
normal and the extra PowerMock functionality is only invoked when the
@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class) annotation is specified.

The existing nsswitch tests are rewritten as BDD tests and additional
tests are added.  Fluent classes and utility methods are used make the
tests as readable as possible, at the risk of somewhat obfuscating
what is actually going on.

Dependency changes:
* this CL migrates from google-collections to guava
* this CL introduces a dependency on google gson

IML files:
Note, because I'm using IJ 10, I'm not sure that my local
edits are going to be backwards compatible.  I left them out of this
CL.  This means that the guava and gson deps will need to be added
to the .iml files for intellij to pick up the new deps (I'm not sure what
the best thing to do here would have been).

- Added support for NonOSGiLoaderProxyTest to compile using java 7, missing method in javax.sql.DataSource.
- Fixed type in integration-tests/tests/src/test/resources/log4j.properties, looked like a copy and paste mistake.

- Updated EquinoxPlatform to put all temporary files under the test-support modules target directory (as is standard maven practice).
- Updated AbstractConfigurableOsgiTests to remove the spring specific deprecated osgi framework selector system property, now only uses the blueprint specific property.
- Fixed spelling typo in AbstractOnTheFlyBundleCreatorTests.
- Updated boot-bundles.properties with newer dependency versions, updated some dependencies to the official artifactId's (spring and slf4j) and replaced commons-logging with jcl-over-slf4j.
- Added relativePath to test-support/pom.xml, removed unnecessary groupId definition, fixed typo in jarjar.dep property, updated junit dependency version, updated spring dependencies to the official artifactIds, updated knopflerfish dependency to the official groupId, moved the maven-surefire-plugin to the pluginManagement section.
- Updated /pom.xml
  - Made maven 3.0.3 a prerequisite for running the build.
  - Added missing source encoding property.
  - Added missing env.* property's, without which the build won't run.
  - Use the official knopflerfish version (don't worry - the same exact binary as before)
  - The gemini.blueprint.version.range.nq property now uses the maven property ${project.version} instead of a custom one with exactly the same value.
  - Removed a bunch of commented out modules, that don't exist anyway.
  - Removed some no longer existent dependencies (gemini-blueprint-web, gemini-blueprint-annotation, spring-osgi-web-extender) which were causing the build the fail.
  - Replaced all spring dependency artifactId's with the official ones, as the official spring dependencies have long contained the correct osgi metadata.
  - Excluded all references to commons-logging, replaced by jcl-over-slf4j.
  - Removed a bunch of spring web dependencies, that are no longer used.
  - Updated the dependency on osgi compendium to the official artifactId and version.
  - Added the org.osgi.core dependency, so that unit tests (not including integration tests) will compile, run and pass. You no longer need to specify a osgi implementation profile. The API is standard and exists separate from the containers we test with, so why not use it.
  - Updated junit to version 4.9.0.
  - Updated log4j to the latest version and now uses the official groupId and artifactId, as the official binaries contain the correct osgi metadata.
  - Added missing version info for the maven-compiler-plugin.
  - Updated jarjar dependency to the official groupId, artifactId and version.
  - Cleaned up usages of maven property's in the bundlor plugin.
  - Tried to update to the latest version of the bundlor plugin - fixed up the config, and I can see it is producing the ""correct"" osgi metadata (the current plugin isn't) but it does not run, so left it commented out to come back to later. Not even sure how the current version of the plugin works as the metadata is products is incorrect (or so I think..)
  - Removed no longer existent samples profile/module.
  - Specify versions for the reporting plugins.

* Add tracing data to internal messages

Add message real sender detection
Add the trace data and other context data to the SLF4J MDC

* Better detect receiver type, add handler method

* Finish base implementation of tracing data

Keep log correlation when using Scheduled Messages
Add ability to provide external sender data and tracing data

* Use standard logging for tests

* Several changes to tracing and logging contexts

Centralizes handling of contexts in the MessagingContextManager
Add distinction between scheduled and normal messages
Add creation method to CreationContext
Add handler method to MessageHandlingContext
Make all context handling exception-free and auto closeable
Ensure creation and trace contexts are propagated when scheduling
Centralize message creation/trace data propagation handling

* Add log message on Echo actor to view trace data

* Shorten method/class string representations

Also tests that method context is being injected correctly

* Add string-shortening overloading constructors

* Guard against unlikely but possible out of bounds

* Remove extra space when joining method args

* Add external reference to current trace context

This makes it easier to handle asynchronous requests in Spring

* Be explicit about trace context maybe being null

* Integration for Spring beans and ThreadBound.*

Add (optional) Bean postprocessor to inject tracing in executors
Add (optional) wrappers for Executor, Runnable and Callable
Wrap ThreadBoundRunnable to enable propagating TraceContext
Ensure we're (almost always) going to have a trace context set
Change the log format to enable colored output and constant width
Make thread names slightly more compact

* Make test thread-safe

* Make automatic tracing configuration less invasive

Also run the whole actor lifecycle tasks inside receiver tracing context
Improve/fix tests
Add closed property to scope to make it easier to use it in async web

* Add tracing to more tests, clean SimpleScheduler

Cancel pending tasks in SimpleScheduler when it shuts down
Execute most message listeners under the same trace context as the msg

* Add more debug logging, change toString format

* Remove unused method

* Use log level TRACE for more detailed information

* Trigger CI

* Support trace IDs in epoch128 format

* Avoid memory leak, ensure creation context is propagated to asynchronous tasks

* Only enable tracing if the user includes the elasticactors-tracing module

* Centralize the (de) serialization of trace and creation contexts

* Replace ThreadLocal.set(null) with ThreadLocal.remove()

* Don't display blank spaces when there is no trace

* Simplify class hierarchy and naming

* Fix Trace ID having more characters than specified",org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j org.slf4j:slf4j,"

This commit changes the default version of Tomcat to 8.5.3 while
also retaining support for Tomcat 8.0 and 7.0. The main difference
in 8.5 is that the ServerSocketFactory abstraction that allowed the
TrustStore and KeyStore to be configured programatically no longer
exists. This logic has been replaced with the use of a custom URL
protocol (springbootssl) that provides access to the key store and
trust store of an SslStoreProvider. In addition to working with 8.5,
this approach has the advantage of also working with 8.0 and 7.0.

Some Guice functionality, specifically the dynamic creation of
classes, does not work on Android. The code that Dagger2
generates will however work on Android so is a suitable
replacement.

Some issues/reduction in capability:

1. Both benchmark classes and ResultProcessor instances were created through the Guice injector which meant that they could potentially use @Inject and have access to any bindings available from that injector, although the available bindings are not defined as part of the public API. Dagger 2 has no dynamic capabilities like Guice and so in order to work with these changes they would need a public no-argument constructor.
2. There are a number of groups of classes that are configurable, e.g. Instrument and ResultProcessor. Custom versions of ResultProcessor are affected by the previous issue. Built in instances of ResultProcessor and Instrument are both managed in a similar way.

The available built in instances are accessible through a `Map<Class<? extends T>, Provider<T>>` (where T is either ResultProcessor or Instrument). The list of configured classes is then scanned, and each configured class is used to find the appropriate `Provider<T>` from the map, it is an error if it does not exist. The `Provider<T>` is then used to create the instance of that object. This uses the `@Provides(type = Type.MAP)` mechanism coupled with custom `@MapKey` annotations, one for each type. That means that adding new types of Instrument or ResultProcessor (built in ones that do not have a public no-argument constructor) requires adding new @Provides methods.
3. The `@MainScope` custom scope annotation is really an alias for the `@Singleton`. The reason why it is needed is that `@Singleton` components cannot depend on other `@Singleton` components, but a custom scoped component can depend on any number of other components in the same scope.

JCommander has a simpler API and better documentation. It is slightly more code
(this change adds about 37K to the invoker jar).

Also reorganize the Invoker class with a more usual structure.

As a consequence of this change, command line options are spelled e.g. --port
rather than -port. JCommander would support either (or indeed both) but this
is more in line with what people expect.

* Interim checkin as there is quite a lot that has changed

* Another interim check-in for the junit4-5 changes

* Added graph and store changes for junit 4->5 conversion

* Gave up on converting the integration-test module. Just added the vintage junit5 dependency. Interim check-in. Up to accumulo-store

* Unfortunately just another checkin. Have successfully converted spark-accumulo-library

* Successfully converted library/cache-library, library/flink-library, store-implementation/map-store and store-implementation/parquet-store

* Converted all of the unit tests but could not get the OperationServiceV1IT working when run with the other integration tests. However, it would run in isolation. Have added a TODO comment to find out why.

* Finished the junit4->5 conversion. All tests are now successful.

* Went through the code and set some of the integration tests i had changed back from junit5 -> 4. Tidied the code.

* Corrected some errors and successfully ran a maven install on the Gaffer project

* The accumulo-store integration tests no longer pass since I re-merged with develop. Lokking into why by finding the differences in the files

* Fixed most of the accumulo issues but a couple still remain that are disabled for the moment. Will merge the changes and open another ticket to look at these

* Failed testing for Travis but did not say where it failed because of mvn -q flag. Will try with Travis debug settings to find out where it failed

* Ignored the AccumuloStoreClassicKeysITs test to see if that is the cause. Made further changes to debug Travis

* Un-ignoring junit 4 integration tests that should run to see if they are successful using Travis

* Re-ignoring OperationServiceV2IT as it is still broken

and junit integration (GraylogBackendExtension).

* Use real artifacts instead of relying on manually created ones

- Take server jar from target folder
- Take sigar lib from lib folder

* Load default plugins

The definition of plugin jars in api-it-tests.properties is a bit verbose,
but I decided to leave it like this, because I think it's easier to understand
than dynamic generation of jar file locations in code.
We might still decide to make it more dynamic when enabling additional plugins.

* Fix forbiddenapis errors

* Set permissions for docker-entrypoint.sh explicitly

Local filesystem permissions don't seem to be retained reliably

* Fix dumb mistake in NodeInstance#getApiAddress

* Use URI instead of filename

...because forbiddenapis says so.

* Mvn package server when executing tests from Intellij

* Move new integration tests to existing module

- Moved the test class
- Deactivated all old tests
- Changed how docker-entrypoint.sh resource is converted to file
  Before it went via URI, which doesn't work when executing tests
  from a different module. Write resource to temp file instead,

* Add explanatory comments for permissions workarounds

* Mount jars into container instead of building into image

* Move full backend test to separate module

- Created new module full-backend-tests
- Run all tests in module with failsafe, not surefire,
  to ensure that they only run on `mvn verify`.
  This allows running `mvn package` without running
  these slow tests.

* Run only mvn package on travis

Travis doesn't package plugins, so extra steps would  be needed to
run full backend tests.
It should be sufficient to run these tests only in the jenkins build

* Disable failsafe integration tests on travis explicitly

`-Dmaven.test.skip=true` was not enough in the second `after_success` step.

* Add CLASS and METHOD lifecycle for backend

- Added serverLifecycle property to ApiIntegrationTest annotation
- default to METHOD where server is restarted after each test

* Avoid recreating containers for GraylogBackend per test class

Converted GraylogBackend to singleton. This ensures that images
and containers can reused globally.

* Add license headers

* Use project graylog.conf instead of copy

* Use project log4j2.xml instead of copy

* Package jars when not running in Maven

...instead of when running in Intellij explicitly

* Extract tmp file creation from NodeInstance

- Added separate class ResourceUtil to extract this
  detail from NodeInstance

* Allow setting env var to skip packaging

- Use existing jars, if env var GRAYLOG_IT_SKIP_PACKAGING
  is set to ""true"" (ignoring case)

* Upgrade rest-assured to 4.2.0

* Allow remote debugging of graylog server

This allows to attach a remote debugger to the server container.
The biggest caveat is that the dynamic port to which the debugger can be
attached is only known after starting the container. Hence one would
have to set a breakpoint after the container start to pause execution,
identify the debug port and start the remote debugger with it.

- Added debug toggle via env var GRAYLOG_IT_DEBUG_SERVER
- Added optional debug build arg to container
- Added logging of debug port, if debugging is enabled
- Extracted building the container to NodeContainerFactory

* Add license headers

* Disable purging data for Lifecycle.CLASS

Doesn't work, because you can't wipe the mongodb from underneath a running server.
Tests failed, because all permissions were gone. But there would probably have been
even more issues like that.
So when Lifecycle.CLASS is chosen, all data remains in the DBs across tests.

* Enable Elasticsearch fixtures

* Refactored BackendStartupIT#importsElasticsearchFixtures

... to make it easier to understand

* Cleanup

* Added param object NodeContainerConfig

* Added README explaining local config options

Placed it in the `testing.completebackend` package in lack of a better
idea where to put it. Can be moved somewhere else after the contents
have been reviewed.

* Reduce docker-entrypoint.sh to necessary parts

- Deleted unnecessary code from docker-entrypoint.sh
  (was originally copied from https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog-docker)
- Created contentpacks dir also in Dockerfile
  Dir creation was actually redundant in Dockerfile and docker-entrypoint.sh.
  The contentpacks dur was the only one missing in Dockerfile.

* Skip forbiddenapis check in MavenPackager

* Add braces around one-line conditional blocks

...to comply with coding standards.

* Start mongodb and node in sequence

...because starting them in parallel is not safe, as @bernd
pointed out in a review.

* Move configuration of RequestSpecification to GraylogBackendExtension

- Make RestAssured RequestSpecification injectable to allow reuse
- Configure baseUri, port, and basePath to avoid having to concat
  the api path in every test

* Set additional env vars in NodeContainerFactory

- GRAYLOG_LB_RECOGNITION_PERIOD_SECONDS: save time on server shutdown
- GRAYLOG_VERSIONCHECKS: avoid contacting version check service
- add explanatory comment for ADMIN_PW_SHA2

* Use constant for GRAYLOG_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS

* Add JavaDocs to explain the ApiIntegrationTest annotation

* Log Maven command when packaging fails

* Improve temp file creation

- More descriptive filename
- Use `File.createTempFile` explicitly
- Delete on exit

* Reset skip flag for old integration tests to ""true""

Setting it to ""false"" slipped in when investigating how difficult it would
be to port them to the new solution.

* Use explicit Locale for String.format

...as required by our forbiddenapis check

* Add check for Maven executable

During his review @kmerz had the issue that the Maven executable
couldn't be found and the resulting error message was not very
helpful for him.
This should make that error more explicit for the user.

* Fix maven command

Accidentally left in ""echo $PATH"" after debugging. :/

* Added alternative check for failing maven command

...to see which one triggers on @kmerz's system.
Will remove one of them afterwards.

* Warn about ~ in PATH when mvn executable not found

- Extracted check for executable to own class
- Added explicit warning about ~ in PATH to exception message
- Added a note to the Readme, pointing out the directory for mvn in PATH
  must not contain a ~",com.google.guava:guava com.jayway.restassured,"...because forbiddenapis says so.

Jersey is relying on jaxws-rs for sending REST requests. Unfortunately it is possible for other, external components to also use jaxws-rs, but a different version. If the two versions are on the same classpath then we see conflicts. In order to avoid conflicts, we have relocated the packages used by schemaregistry-client, so the package javax.ws.rs becomes com.hortonworks.registries.shaded.javax.ws.rs. This way, both jaxws-rs libraries are on the classpath, but due to the difference in package names they are not in conflict.

Set version to 0.9.1 in order to avoid conflicts with the snapshot repo.

This change was necessary to get the required jersey server version to
work with the most recent AWS SDK. However, it required a handful of
internal changes to get it to behave properly. Most importantly, these were
- Major version bump from jersey 1 to jersey 2, which included migrating
  between groupId's. It only required one piece of code-rewriting, which
  was reasonably small.
- Migrating groupId's from com.codahale.metrics to io.dropwizard.metrics.
  There was no real code changes involved, but Maven couldn't detect
  artifact conflicts between these two because they had different

1. Bump TinkerPop dependency from 3.4.10 to 3.5.0 and resolve
dependency conflicts. Several jackson packages are ignored from
requireUpperBoundDeps maven enforce plugin now, because Spark 3.0.0
requires a lower version of jackson (2.10.0) while other libraries,
including CQL driver, require a higher version of jackson.
2. Support null value mutation semantics to comply with TinkerPop 3.5.0.
property(single, prop, null) removes the property while
property(list/set, prop, null) is simply ignored.
3. Introduce a workaround for traversal strategies which can be removed
once TINKERPOP-2568 is fixed.
4. Upgrade apache common configuration to configuration2 to comply
with the same TinkerPop breaking change. Now users won't experience the
problem reported at #1447 anymore, since configuration2 by default does
not read comma delimited string as a list of values.
5. Other minor changes mostly caused by breaking changes in TinkerPop.

Merge changes from Alfresco/spring-social-salesforce
-Unable to fully use Salesforce Sandbox
--Remove hardcoded userinfo url in useroperations
--Add the ability to pass in the gateway url for the authorization
server used in userinfo
-getBlob is returning a closed InputStream
--override ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter to allow all media types
--change extractor to use the byteArray message converter in the
RestRemplate
--to keep the existing method signature as InputStream return byteArray
as byteArrayInputStream
--remove default content-type header used in other tests to allow return
on non json content.
-Update Salesforce API version used
--Add method to set version to be used by method calls
--Add validation to version provided
--Default version is now v37.0
--Refactor where version and default version are located (ApiTemplate
and ApiOperations
--Update all uses of API_VERSION to now use getVersion method
--Update and Add Tests for version string
--Add getServices method that does not require version to be passed but
uses the current set version
--When the version number passed to setVersion is invalid (format,
blank, null) we no longer silently fail but throw
InvalidSalesforceApiVersionException.
-JsonParseException when response is BAD_OAUTH_TOKEN
--Bad_OAuth_Token is returned as a single string not json as expected
from other errors
--Add code to look at jsonParseException to test if it is actually this
error. Return this error in the proper format to be handled as a known
error. This will allow so that when (if) Salesforce fixes this issue a
new release will not be needed.
--Response handling suffers drom the same end of stream close issue
after single use.  Buffer the stream as a byteArray so that it can be
used in error handling and additional testing after an exception is
thrown.
--When Bad_OAuth_Token is found it is returned as
InvalidAuthorizationException instead of as an
InsufficientPermissionException.  The former should be recoverable with
a token refresh (uses a refresh token).  The latter should indicate a
need to reauthenticate and possible approve additional
permissions/scopes for the user.

of the used libraries. This is in violation of the servlet specification and resulted in a warning during the
application startup. We have now excluded this bad servlet-api dependency, but it has to be declared now in the
webapp pom.xml as ""provided"". So add the following dependency section in webapp/pom.xml :

Now we solely rely on Spring to provide the web application part

This avoids the mix between Spring controllers and JAX-RS classes

This commit also introduces the following changes:

* Remove dependencies related to MongoDB ; Spring can't properly handle
  a JDBC connection with the noise that the Mongo related dependencies
  produce.

  The MongoDB stuff is broken at the moment anyway.

* Remove all the XML related configuration. There are more or less
  cryptic and detached from the code which lessen the change to
  understand what's going on behind the scene when there's an issue.

  Let's rely on annotations instead.

* Avoid having dozen different files to configure properties and
  specifically the connection to the database.

  Everything is now stored in `application.properties`.

* Properly package the logging stuff with the application. Otherwise,
  debugging is painful and we need to download external JARs and put
  them in a folder in the classpath.",org.springframework.boot:spring-boot org.glassfish.jersey,"of the project.

Repository cache considering Spaces

Repo migration tool probably need to get all repos

Only user spaces should be indexed

 Only user spaces should be indexed - unit test fix

few unit test fixes

fix for weld test

file system unit test fixes

Add methods for querying repos/projects by space, to allow lookup outside of active context.

End batch after copying in RepositoryCopierImpl

more unit test fixes

test fixes

path fixes

Remove WorkspaceProjectContext from backend. Pass space as parameter when required.

Duplicated repo list when they have same alias

Echoing rest services

Don't memoize spaces in SpacesAPI. Move method to load all spaces to OrganizationalUnitService.

* Changes based on PR feedback.

* Remove redundant getModules form AbstractModuleService
* Don't fire rename event if move/save throw exceptions

* Inject SpacesAPI not SpacesAPIImpl

* Make WorkspaceProjectContextChangeEvent @LocalEvent (details below)

This event is a return type of RPCs, but shouldn't be fired from client to server when used as CDI event.

* Some small changes from code review

* When removing organizational unit, first remove all contained projects.

* Return Optional from WorkspaceProjectContext and improve error handling of callers.

* fixing rest

* fixes for rest project clone

* Renames duplicated projects to avoid same name on the screen.

Modernize the pom.xml:
* Update jmxutils to 1.12
* Update metrics to 2.1.1
* Update Jetty to 8.1.2.v20120308 and servlet api 3.0.1
* Update slf4j to 1.6.4
* Update Jersey to 1.12
* Update Guava to 11.0.2

Get rid of log4j dependency and use logback instead.
I've replaced the log4j.xml with a logback.xml.

The healthcheck has been updated to Metrics 2.x.x APIs.

I have also simplified the Guice listeners by using the
skeleton 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT builder, which simplifies most of
the glue code.

We were importing both OSGI interfaces relocated by Felix and the ones
provided by the org.osgi groupId.

This was causing conflicts at runtime on certain deployments. We now only
use the Felix ones.

The integration mostly relies on the JCache (aka JSR-107) specification,
except for Shiro which is Ehcache specific.

Main user-facing changes:

* cache metrics are now prefixed with jcache.statistics
  instead of net.sf.ehcache.Cache
* new ehcache.xml syntax (see http://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.3/xml.html)

- All HTable were switched to Table, same for HBaseAdmin to Admin.
- All flushCommits() calls were removed since they were removed. 
- Jetty and all dependencies (JSP being a big one) were updated to the latest version, which required some minor code updates in Hush itself. The biggest issue was the POM and getting the transitive dependencies as explicit one right. 
- Fixed also two NPE problems that caused problems in userstats.jsp (stats were null) and getting the username without cookies (in HushUtils).

This patch is part of getting Opencast getting to not fail with Java 9+.
It fixes a lot of dependency problems I've found when making the
necessary changes for Java 9+ (e.g. explicitly adding java.ee dependencies).

Note that despite the large number of changes the only two non-test,
non-dependency fixes are two places in our code where `commons.lang` was
still used instead of `commons.lang3`.

The main parts of this patch are:

- Explicitly declaring the java.ee dependencies:
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/43574427/2352895
- Fixing obvious dependency problems which popped up due to some modules
  dependencies now being declared more precisely.
- Updating and centralizing the version of `rest-assured` which was
  partly specified incorrectly.

Note that while this patch fixes a lot of the Java 9 problems and nearly
all modules can now be built using Java 9, a few (unfortunately large)
problems still persist:

- The default date format for some languages has changed in Java 9 which
  causes a few tests in the admin interface to fail. I expect this to be
  harmless and think the tests just need adjustment, but I did not want
  to make that change without the ability to test it properly.
- We are on ElasticSearch version 1.7.6. Java 9 is supported starting
  with version 6.2. We had already discussed in the past that upgrading
  this is something we would like to do. Unfortunately, it's a lot of
  work.
- We also need to upgrade to Karaf 4.2.x. At the moment, the assembly
  steps fail due to us using an old Karaf version. Fortunately, we are
  already on 4.0.10 which isn't that far away (compared to ES). Still,
  it's some work.

Hence, consider this a first step. Obviously, I could also not test for
any runtime problems so far. The other problems need to be resolved
first.

Note though, that this does not only fix dependencies for Java 9. Most
of the problems are quite relevant for older Java versions as well.",org.apache.commons:commons-lang3 commons-codec:commons-codec,"

This patch enables *optional* automated dependency checks on Opencast
modules. While Opencast rpovides a default configuration, modules still
need to opt-in by including the maven-depenency-plugin.

If this works, long term, we could at some point enforce dependency
checking globally to prevent depedency problems right from the start.

---

Note that the dependency plugin is not perfect and may complain about
pure runtime dependencies (e.g. it does not know that we may want to
attach a logger to our test and may complain about it being an
unnecessary dependency).

But the plugin allows making exceptions for such cases. This means that
developers can still declare any dependencies they like, but they are
forced to consider if they actually make sense since they need to
possibly whitelist them if they are not directly used.

Since embedding Elasticsearch is no longer supported, the embedded node
is removed. Elasticsearch 7 does no longer allow to store different
document types in the same index. Instead, one index per document type
is required. So the code was changed to create four ""sub indices"", one
for each document type. This means, that for the admin UI index, there
are actually 4 Elasticsearch indices now. The same applies for the
external API index.

So from now on, running an external Elasticsearch node is mandatory in
order to be able to run Opencast.

This patch improves compatibility with newer JDKs. Namely, it is now
possible to build and run Opencast with JDK11. For JDK12 and JDK13,
building Opencast is possible as well, while running Opencast is not
possible with these JDKs, yet.

Since we want to stay compatible with JDK1.8 for now, language features
of newer JDKs cannot be used at the moment. Once we decide to drop
JDK1.8 support, new language features can be used without any further
preparations, except increasing the `jdk.version` in the main POM.

The following table shows the current state of Opencast compatibility
with some JDKs.

| JDK  | Build | Run | Language Features |
|------|-------|-----|-------------------|
|JDK1.8|  YES  | YES |        YES        |
|JDK11 |  YES  | YES |        NO         |
|JDK13 |  YES  | NO  |        NO         |

Compatibility with JDK 9, 10, and 12 was not tested, but for JDK 9 and
10, full (build _and_ runtime) compatibility is much likely given.

To also achieve runtime compatibility with JDK12 and JDK13, Karaf 4.3
is needed, which is not yet released. Once the new Karaf version is
available, enabling JDK12 and JDK13 runtime compatibility should be
fairly easy.

In order to achieve runtime compatibility with JDK11, a little quirk was
necessary: `jakarta.xml.bind-api-2.3.3.jar` had to be packaged with
Opencast as this version is required for JDK11. Version 2.3.3 of this
library is already released, but not yet uploaded to Maven Central
because it is part of the upcoming Java EE release, which was not yet
published. Once this is published, the packaged jar can most likely be
replaced with a Maven reference. Once Karaf comes with a Java EE version
including version 2.3.3 of jakarta.xml.bind-api or higher, it should no
longer be necessary to manually manage this dependency at all.

To enable compatibility with newer Java versions, lots of dependencies
were updated. Also, Java EE is currently in the process of renaming all
artifacts named `javax.something` to `jakarta.something-else` due to
legal issues with the term `javax`. Hence, a lot of pom files had to be
touched as upgrading a dependency also meant to rename it in many cases.

After upgrading all the dependencies, a few issues came up which are
worth being mentioned:

- JPA was complaining about duplicate column names in some queries. So I
  had to extend 3 `@JoinColumn` annotations.
- With Java 9, breaking changes to locales were made which caused some
  date formatting code parts to break. This was fixed by setting the
  JDK's `java.locale.providers` property to `COMPAT`.
- The `Lazy` class caused strange behavior where class files of classes
  using `Lazy` were compiled differently by different JDKs, even though
  both JDKs were compiling for the same byte version. This caused test
  failures. Since `Lazy` could be easily replaced and seemed to not
  provide any advantages, it was removed.
- Since Jetty had to be updated from version 1.x to version 2.x, some
  major changes to the `rest-test-environment` bundle were necessary.

The file `system.properties.append` used to configure XML processing
related factories to use internal JDK classes. This was changed to use
JDK-independent classes to improve compatibility with future JDKs.

Upgrading the ActiveMQ client library was not necessary, but was done
anyway.

Since a lot of dependencies were changed, the Maven part of `NOTICES`
was re-generated.",jakarta.ws.rs:jakarta.ws.rs-api javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api,"longer be necessary to manually manage this dependency at all.

removed the global test dependency on slf4j-nop, because it clutters the
dependency information and is in many cases just wrong (e.g. the build-tools

As a consequence, the maven tests now log error messages about missing slf4j
implementations again. For now however, this seems to be the best solution,
since none of the AutomataLib modules actually require a logging implementation

Major version upgrade from 1.19.3 to 2.27. New version has a different
groupId and package name. Licenses are different too because Jersey
code moved to Eclipse Foundation. It uses newer version of the JAX-RS
specification which contains many new interfaces.

Majority of code changes are around container dependency injection.
Jersey 1.x had its own dependency injection framework and 2.x uses
HK2 as the dependency injection container. Registration of custom
injectables is thus very different. They are now registered in
`ComponentsBinder` which is itself registered in the top-level
container component called `ResourceConfig`.

Other notable change is in transaction handling for REST requests.
Previously, transactions were open in a request dispatcher. There is
no such concept in new Jersey. Container request filter is used
instead.

Removed usages of proprietary Jersey APIs like base64 decoding.
Removed dependency on the old custom forked JAX-RS API.",javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api com.sun.jersey:jersey,"

- Replace mockito-all with mockito-core to avoid pulling in outdated

Updating to the Java EE 7 versions:  Servlet 3.1, JSF 2.2, EL 3.0, and

Side effects:

1.  Update to Tomcat 8.5.  Repaired so that it works.
2.  Update Showcases to latest version.
3.  Update Weld to 2.4.7 and Mojarra to 2.3.7.
4.  Update JSTL to 1.2 and use jstl group.
5.  Paramaterize so that versions stay consistent.
6.  Update existing versions to latest.
7.  Remove special version of Xalan that was needed for Java EE 6.
8.  Exclude jconsole so the JDK version is used instead of the Wildfly

9.  Update to latest httpclient 4.5.6

This patch changes JSON provider to GSON, skipping jackson
packaging completely.  GSON is used by many upstream ODL
projects and is the desired single JSON library for the
future.

Some unit tests surrounding Handlers needed to be ignored
temporarily due to classpath issues;  some of the overlapping
technology is tested in integration-test so the AAA team
feels it is okay to temporarily disable for now.

For now, this change exposes a provider package for the
GsonProvider so that other projects running into the same
issue can utilize it without copying and pasting code.
Later, it will be moved somewhere more intelligent.

The latter results in a dependency on an automatic module, but
that is not really a problem as we never touch them at runtime.

it still needs to be discoverable via reflection, we dedicate

This patch upgrades the oVirt Engine to use the modern JUnit Jupiter
5.2 for its unit tests. JUnit Jupiter is quite different from the old
JUnit 4 and even JUnit 5 vintage, so this patch contains quite a few
changes:

1. Maven:
   a. The org.junit.vintage:junit-vintage-engine was removed and
      replaced with org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine in order
      to provide the basic JUnit JUpiter capabilities.
   b. The org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-params dependency was added
      in order to provide the @ParameterizedTest annotation and its
      related helpers. See 7a and 7b for additional details.
   c. The org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter dependency was added in
      order to provide MockitoExtension. See 7c for additional
      details.
   d. org.junit.platform:junit-platform-surefire-provider was added
      as an explicit dependency to the maven-surefire-plugin in order
      to properly execute JUnit Jupiter tests.

2. Lifecycle annotations:
   a. org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll and
      org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll are used as drop-in replacements
      for org.junit.BeforeClass and org.junit.AfterClass,
      respectively.
   b. org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach and
      org.junit.juiter.api.AfterEach are used as replacements for
      org.junit.Before and org.junit.After, respectively. One slight
      difference is that the vintage engine treats methods overriding
      methods annotated with @Before/@After as if they themselves were
      annotated with that annotation. JUnit Jupiter requires that
      overriding methods be explicitly annotated with
      @BeforeEach/AfterEach themselves.

3. Test annotations:
   a. org.junit.jupiter.api.Test was used as a drop-in replacement
      for org.junit.Test in the simple case of an annotation with no
      arguments, which org.junit.jupiter.api.Test doesn't support.
   b. Usages of org.junit.Test with the ""expected"" arguments were
      replaced with org.junit.jupiter.api.Test and an explicit call
      to org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions#assertThrows on the
      relevant code. A side benefit of this approach is that it makes
      the test a tad stricter, and prevents false-positives where the
      ""preparation"" code throws the exception instead of the actual
      code the test intended to test.
   c. Usages of org.junit.Test with the ""timeout"" arguments were
      replaced with org.junit.jupiter.api.Test and an explicit call
      to org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions#assertTimeout on the
      relevant code. A side benefit of this approach is that it makes
      the test a tad stricter, and prevents false-positives where the
      ""preparation"" code takes too long and not the actual code the
       test intended to test.
    d. org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled was used as a drop-in
       replacement for org.junit.Ignore.

4. Assertions:
   a. The variants of the assertion methods in org.junit.Assert that
      do not include a failure message (assertTrue, assertFalse,
      assertEquals, assertNotEquals, assertArrayEquals, assertNull,
      assertNotNull, assertSame, assertNotSame)
      were replaced by the drop in replacements in
      org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.
   b. The variants of the methods mentioned in 4a that are overloaded
      to include a failure message as the first argument were
      replaced with their counterparts in
      org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions, but these variants have the
      failure message as the *last* argument, not the *first*
      argument.
   c. assertEquals(double expected, double actual, double delta) and
      its overloaded counterpart with a message do not accept deltas
      of 0.0 like the methods in org.junit.Assert used to. 0.0001 is
      used as an arbitrary small delta to signify both values are
      equal in the project's regards.
   d. org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions does not contain an assertThat
      method. Instead, as per the recommendation in the documentation,
      Hamcrest's org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert#assertThat was used
      instead.

5. Assumptions
   a. The variants of the assumeTrue and assumeFalse methods in
      org.junit.Assume that do not include a failure message were
      replaced by the drop in replacements in
      org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions.
   b. The variants of the methods mentioned in 5a that are overloaded
      to include a failure message as the first argument were
      replaced with their counterparts in
      org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions, but these variants have the
      failure message as the *last* argument, not the *first*
      argument.
   c. org.junit.jupiter.api.Assumptions does not contain assumeNull
      and assumeNotNull methods. Instead, the same behavior was
      achieved by using assumeTrue and assumeFalse with explicit
      conditions.

6. @Rules and @ClassRules
   a. ExpectedException usages were replaced with explicit calls to
      assertThrows. Similarly to the usecase of org.junit.Test with
      an ""expected"" parameter, explicitly using assertThrows on the
      call(s) that are supposed to throw an exception allow for finer
      grained control and slightly stricter tests.
   b. TemporaryFolder was replaced, in the one place it was used,
      ConfigurationTest, with inline @BeforeEach and @AfterEach
      methods that implemented the limited subset of functionality
      that test required.
   c. MockConfigRule was removed, as JUnit Jupiter no longer
      supports rules, and was replaced with MockConfigExtension.
      This extension is configured by implementing a
      mockConfiguration() public static method that returns a
      Stream<MockConfigDescriptor> to be mocked. While extensions do
      not provide the flexibility of changing the mocked
      configuration in runtime, like the old MockConfigRule did, it
      allows configuring, per method, what mock configuration
      supplier method will be used (by annotating it with the
      @MockedConfig method), which seems to be sufficient to the
      project's needs.
   d. MockEngineLocalConfigRule was removed, as JUnit Jupiter no
      longer supports rules, and was replaced with
      MockEngineLocalConfigExtension.
      This extension is configured by implementing a
      mockEngineLocalConfiguration() public static method that
      returns a Stream<Pair<String, String>>> to be mocked.
   e. InjectorRule was removed, as JUnit Jupiter no longer supports
      rules, as was replaced with InjectorExtension. Instead of the
      boiler-plate code required to bind mocks, this extension will
      automatically detect public fields annotated with @InjectedMock
      and will bind them to the type they are declared by.
   f. ExecutorServiceRule was removed, as JUnit Jupiter no longer
      supports rules, as was replaced with ExecutorServiceExtension.
   g. RandomUtilsSeedingRule was removed, as JUnit Jupiter no longer
      supports rules, as was replaced with
      RandomUtilsSeedingExtension.
   h. UiCommonSetupRule was removed, as JUnit Jupiter no longer
      supports rules, as was replaced with UiCommonSetupExtension.
      The pointless inner interface, Mocks, was removed, and instead
      users can access the mocks via the traditional getters (e.g.,
      Frontend.getInstance()). Additionally, RETURN_DEEP_STUBS was
      used when mocking the ConstatnsManager instead of boiler-plate
      implementing the same logic.

7. Runners
   a. org.junit.runners.Parameterized, which no longer exists (since
      JUnit Jupiter does not have a concept of runners any more) was
      replaced with explicit annotations of
      org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest on the relevant
      tests. Usually the old @Parameters were replaced with a
      @MethodSource, but in the places were other source could be used
      easily, they were.
   b. org.junit.experimental.theories.Theories, which no longer
      exists (since JUnit Jupiter does not have a concept of runners
      any more) was replaced with explicit annotations of
      org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest on the relevant
      tests. Usually the old @DataPoint and @DataPoints were replaced
      with a @MethodSource, but in the places were other source could
      be used easily, they were.
   c. org.mockito.junit.MockitoJunitRunner,
      org.mockito.junit.MockitoJunitRunner.Strict,
      org.mockito.junit.MockitoJunitRunner.Silent and the deprecated
      org.mockito.junit.runners.MockitoJunitRunner were replaced with
      a @ExtendWith(MockitoAnnotation.class) annotation. Where it
      worked effortlessly the default strict form of the extension
      was used, but in most cases,
      @MockitoSettings(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT) was added.
      Removing this leniency is a possible task for future patches.
   d. SpringJUnit4ClassRunner was replaced with SpringExtension.

8. Specific changes
   a. GetConfigurationValueQueryTest was cleaned up to have a single
      @ParameterizedTest cover all the permutation instead of four
      boiler-plate @Test methods.
   b. Since @ParameterizedTest does not allow extending classes to
      supply their own @MethodSource, AppErrorsTest and
      VdsmErrorsTest were removed, and the logic of both the tests
      was condensed in to AbstractConstantsWithLookupTestCase which
      was renamed to the concrete ConstantsWithLookupTest.
   c. BackendEntityAssignedPermissionsResourceTest was made abstract
      so that junit does attempt to run its test cases (and fail since
      it doesn't have a no-arg constructor).

This patch attempts to clean up jaxb relate dependencies that have been
in most cases introduced during migration to java 11.
The main idea was to reuse libs provided by wildfly and to make sure they
were not bundled with ear & war components.

Server Changes
----------------------
- Refactoring and introduction of new launcher/spawner classes in SeLion-Grid
	- Added IOSDriverJarSpawner
	- Added SelendroidJarSpawner
	- Added AppiumSpawner
	- Added ThreadedLauncher for launching selenium hub and web nodes
	  in the same process on a different Thread
	- Added shutdown() to SeLionGridLauncher
	- Introduced interface RunnableLauncher
	- Added abstract and base classes for RunnableLaunchers which are
	  a) in the same process, b) in a separate process, and c) mobile, in a
	  separate process
	- Introduced option to disable continuos restart for the RunnableLauncers
	  which are process spawners
	- Introduced enumeration InstanceType which is used to track the current
	  instance SeLion-Grid is managing and/or booting (e.g. hub, node, etc)
- Added JVM shutdown hook for launcher/runners which spawn a new
  process -- This should help cleanup on Windows
- Relocated class ArtifactDetails and reduced visibility.. it is only used by the
  FileDownloader
- Moved several classes from depending org.apache.commons.lang3 (a
  transitive  dependency of selenium-server -- may not be in the class path) to
  org.apache.commons.lang (which is available)
- Updates to ConfigParser -- fixed LOGGER.entering and added ability to
  getJsonObject
- Added ability for download.json to specify artifact ""roles"" -- which when
  considered by  FileDownloader will only result in an artifact download
  (or ""checksum"" verification) if the  artifact in question is required for the
  current InstanceType
- SeLionConfg.json now allows the user to define default args for Appium,
  Selendroid, and ios-driver
- Introduced MinimalIOSCapabilityMatcher in ""server""
- Add Default-Suite.xml for SeLion-Grid
- FileDownloader can now skip last modified check on file AND

  can be told to not cleanup downloads which may have happened
  previously in the same JVM process
- FileDownloader can now process by artifact names

Other Misc Changes
----------------------------
- Addressed some Javadoc issues from misc classes
- Enabled Dependency Convergence
- Fix #103 -- Usage of org.json
- Add some test classes
- Downgrade to ios-driver 0.6.5 everywhere -- many of our tests and
  sample code still require ios-driver 0.6.6-SNAPSHOT. 0.6.6-SNAPSHPOT
  can be re-intoruced by updating the SelionConfig.json for SeLion-Grid
  and through an pom.xml update on the user's end.
- Introduction of SeLion-Common - Started to push classes which were
  duplicate or needed by more than one SeLion component into this new artifact
- Relocated and/or renamed some classes which were pushed to common
- Moved some SeLionGridConstant vars into common in new class
  SeLionConstants -- they are needed for both client and server and
  since client can run w/o server (it's an optional dependency), it made
  sense to do this.
- Updated archetype to include SeLion-Grid and selenium-server dependencies",commons-lang:commons-lang commons-logging:commons-logging,"
- Introduction of SeLion-Common - Started to push classes which were
duplicate or needed by more than one SeLion component into this new artifact
- Relocated and/or renamed some classes which were pushed to common
FileDownloader
- Moved several classes from depending org.apache.commons.lang3 (a
transitive  dependency of selenium-server -- may not be in the class path) to",3,Logging,

* By Jove, I think this will work.

Use Calcite SQL rewriting to handle translation for DDL into Apollo

observer, mediated by consensus (block based).

F(ck yea!

* Revert ""Remove Graal sdk dep.""

This reverts commit ed1918beb1a1a626d1c982a575820444252d87ed.

* More work.

Fleshing out CDC engine, membership n' rings

* Cleanup

* Ring set ops on Context

* more flesh.

get testing for calcite and ddl to drive transform development.

* pg/sql antlr4

For der WASM

And I need anonymous functions (lambda) for schema *grade

* add back dep

* Starting to fill out calcite model for Apollo chains

* interim

* Initial kernel schema sketch.

My thought is to reify the metadata schema, then transform DDL into
predicates which do the DML on the metadata schema, then perform the
corresponding H2 DDL commands

Implementation of DDL transactions (rather than single statement DDL
transactions) would be through Calcite ""caching"", implicitly making the
trade offs of expensive ops (build index, drop column, drop table,
schema, etc).

Any DDL in batches would be simulated through Calcite, and DML mixed
into all that would operate against this simulation.  The implicit trade
off is one cannot do massive bulk ops through loops or whatever, unless
teh ops are state replicable without breaking bandwidth.

* Generate information schema

Update liquibase to 4.0.0

* interim

* refactor out seeds, so not instance state

* shore up membership abstraction

* moar better HashKey impl

* bite bullet, use HashKey instead of UUID for member id.

It is the right thing to do

* Generisize membership

* use hash for probed key based on id, ring, input key

* clean up

* Interim refactoring commit.

FF refactored to use new membership Context.
Some additional cleanup

* update the rest to membership context.

HashKey[32] is used for ids, rather than UUIDs.

* Use new sampling

* first cut o grpc/proto protocol

* use plugin correctly for grpc code gen

* Refactoring to prepare for GRPC transition.

Working MTLS client/server GRPC with access to ssl session on server
side, tested.

* Remove Avro artifacts, adapt to GRPC

* Refactor Fireflies to grpc regime.

Interim

* merge pre View merge

I think this is all ""safe"" - i.e. correct.

* merge tests

* Working GRPC FF local comm sim

Geebus

* first pass conversin of Avalanche to GRPC

* Avalanche local sim working

:: Sigh :: GRPC.  Amirite?

* first pass on grpc conversion of Ghost

* Further cleanup.

Prep for MTLS conversion

* fix override auth

* Revamp local communications sim.

Create generalized communications abstraction for the multiple services
of Apollo.  Validate with the LocalCommSim implementation for Fireflies

* More work on communications model.

Request to open connection is now never denied, as this does cause
problems.

Clean up.

Ghost, Avalanche, FF working with LocalCommSim

* up to 30 members for testing

* Mtls grpc Communications implementation

Tested for fireflies

* Avalanche working with MTLS

* 5x5

* Remove experiments

* remove posgresql lexer/parser

Will add back when appropriate

* upgrade liquibase version.

allow tls avalanche test to set test cardinality lower, due to
limitations on lesser machines.

* Scope by context ID

* refine a bit for reuse pattern

* Context scoped Avalanche

* Scope all rpcs.

Simplify implementations.

* whoops.  Not Member, but by HashKey id ;)

* Merkle patricia trie for moar efficient anti entropy

Also, too, work on SMR over committee

* rm cruft.  minimal BF

* Add hashes to acc and notes. BFs to gossip messages

* add BF for Gossip digests

* Remove MessageDigest

* Cert gossip now BloomFiltered

* Reimplemented BF. Cert antientropy via BF

Geebus ;)

* notes replicated via BF

* Accusations replicated via BF

* use .25 FPR, everything 5x5

Slightly longer time to reach eventual consistency, far, far less
network traffic.

Good tradeoff.

Uses randomly seeded BloomFilters in gossip to determine replication
between Firefly pairs

* doc

* use active members for accs replication, total view for certs, notes

* metrics stuff

* clean up

* First cut of cleaning deps

* pull in dropwizard deps

* Clean through FF

* clean through avalanche

* clean through bootstrap-service

* bootstrap-client clean

* clean through apollo-web.

still have test failure in BootstrapTest.  Will fix later, as at least
it's not barfing with verify errors now ;)

* generate

* clean deps, through and through

* fix BootstrapTest

* Really fix BootstrapTest.

Problem was that seeds are now passed into the view.start, rather than
the constructor.  D'oh.

* fix dep convergence

* update README.md

The API returns errors with an HTTP code 400, 404 or 500 depending on
the cause with a json object that contains the failure reason.  The
error message should be populate to the JMX calling client, translated
to the appropriate exception.

This patch adds the ability to detect API failure and throw a runtime
exception with the returned message.

It is up to the calling method what to do with the exception, if it
would do nothing, the calling client would get a RuntimeException,
depends on origin MBean definition, the caller can catch the exception
and throw a specific kind.

Note that any exception that is thrown must be known to the JMX client
or it will not be able to process it.

As a first step, this patch replaces the jersey client to the newer
version under glassfish, which has an easy way of getting a Reply
object, and check its status before returning the results.

The only difference in the method that uses the APIClient is the use of
MultivaluedHashMap.

The following MBean implementation where changed

CompactionManager
Gossiper
EndpointSnitchInfo

The main issues included in this release are:

General:

  1. Now Sentilo is compliant with Redis 4, MongoDB 4, Tomcat 8.5  and JRE 1.8

    Sentilo has been tested with the above versions of Redis, MongoDB, Tomcat
    and JRE and from today these are the recommended versions. Previous
    versions are also supported but without any guarantee. We strongly
    recommend to upgrade to these latest versions as soon as possible.

  2. Add support to federate different Sentilo instances.

PubSub Server / API REST:

  3. New field ttl in sensor metadata which allows you to define a custom ttl
     for each sensor.

    In previous releases, sensor data expired time (a.k.a. ttl) was defined
    globally as a configuration parameter and it was always the same for all
    sensors.

  4. New parameter socket.tcp.backlog which allows to adapt your server request
     throughput

    Sentilo uses this parameter to invoke the listen method of the server socket.
    As the JDK documentation defines, this parameter ""[...] sets the maximum queue
    length for incoming connection indications (a request to connect) to the count
    argument. If a connection indication arrives when the queue is full, the
    connection is refused""

  5. Add more info about sensors to the response of the /catalog service API

    The information about sensors returned by the /catalog service now include
    fields like sensor's state.

  6. Improvements in user password definition

    We have redesigned how user passwords are defined: by default, when a new
    user is created its password is equal to its id. Additionally we have add
    a new page which allows any user to change its password at any moment
    (whether or not him will be an administrator). This new password must follow
    a password policy which ensures the use of strong passwords.

  7. New control of maximum number of failed login attempts.

    When authentication attempts exceed the number of permitted consecutive failed
    attempts (configuration parameter with a default value of 3), the user will be
    in a locked state until an administrator enabled him.

  8. Enhancements at the Universal viewer to make it more responsive.

    We have completely redesign how data is displayed when user inspects the content
    of a component, improving its responsiveness and its usability.

  9. New sensor data types and support to visualize media data types

    If sensor data type is defined as one of the new data types available (FILE_LINK,
    VIDEO_LINK, IMAGE_LINK or AUDIO_LINK), i.e. sensor data contains links to external
    resources, then when sensor data will be represented the Catalog will try to use
    an appropriate media player to visualize it into the Catalog.

  10. New administrator option that displays a list with all active subscriptions

  11. Improve visualization of sensor data when it contains a JSON message.

  12. Add CSRF and XSS protection.

dependencies, some codes have been refactored:
- The application cache in the Caching Engine is now based upon the new version
  of ehcache. In its new version the element expiry mechanism has now to be
  explicitly defined. If ehcache 3 provides a default mechanism for TTL-based
  expiry or TTI-based expiry, nothing is provided to define a mechanism based
  upon both TTL and TTI as it was in ehcache 2. So a custom expiry mechanism
  is defined to implement close the way the TTL-and-TTI-based expiry was
  managed in ehcache 2.
  With the new version of ehcache, any null key throws immediately
  NullPointerException. This cause problems with MessageManager that uses the
  application cache and particularely in tests. So, the tests were updated to
  initialize MessageManager and a check is performed in MessageManager when
  accessing the application cache to catch the NullPointerException exception.

- In the last version of Apache POI, the attributes are now encapsultated by
  getter. So replace all the direct attribute accesses by their counterpart
  getter.

- The iCal4J API as some subtle changes. The HTMLProperty is modified
  consequently to those changes.

- In the new Jackson version, the null fields are now also serialized.
  Set a configuration parameter to the ObjectMapper in JSONCodec so that
  Jackson behaves like its previous versions.

- The very old informa library to produce or to consume RSS feeds is now
  replaced by the last version of Rome. All the codes that used informa are now
  refactored to use Rome instead of informa.

- Spring social connectors are updated to their last stable version. For doing,
  as LinkedIn has migrated their OAuth mechanism to OAuth2 and discourages

Years ago, the original thought was to make the file ""user friendly"" by not exposing the direct structure of the underlying object there, and instead using ""friendly"" names for the fields.

I think that the typical user of this will be very technical and not at all put off by camelCase field names, and the reduced code means it will be much more maintainable, as there's not much interesting going on (the exception being the way the default values are handled, but even that is not complicated; see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65483376/deserialize-yaml-in-java-using-defaults-read-earlier-in-file/).",com.fasterxml.jackson org.yaml:snakeyaml,"

The existing LifeCycle feature that heavily relied on Guice has been reworked
into the `com.spotify.heroic.lifecycle` package.

LifeCycle has to be explicitly exported through the appropriate subsystem.

Using `metric` as an example, it expects modules to export
MetricModule.Out#life() to govern the lifecycle of any encapsulated components.

Finally, due to annotation processing issues with Eclipse
(see [./eclipse](eclipse)), a feature Dagger 2 heavily relies on, it is now
recommended to use IDEA for development.
Because of this, all code has been reformatted using the provided style in
idea/code-style.xml.

This change replaces Liquibase[1] with Flyway[2] for database schema
migrations for the following reasons:

1. To avoid DB lock contention issues at startup

We dealt with a number of production outages due to the fact that
Liquibase caused (or otherwise contributed to) lock contention issues
at startup (i.e. when Liquibase needs to lock tables in order to apply
changes to the DB) that resulted in DB connection pool starvation. This
behavior was never isolated and repeated in a test environment, but was
observed several times in practice in production. The workaround has been
to reduce the instance count in production from 4 to 1, but this has its
own negative effects (no redundancy in the case of an app crashing).

So this move to Flyway is in some ways an experiment in which we will
see over time whether it too can result in these locking / starvation
issues. Testing the application under load in an 8-instance environment
suggests that it will not, but only sustained time in production will
tell for sure.

2. Flyway's plain-SQL approach is clearer and more suitable to our needs

Liquibase has a powerful DSL that acts as an abstraction layer over SQL,
making it simple to develop in memory against HSQL while deploying to
production against Postgres. However, it comes at the cost of needing
to understand that DSL (which in practice means looking things up in
Liquibase's documentation each time a change needs to be made). This is
a minor hassle for project committers, but is more important when
considering this application's purpose as a reference app; plain SQL is
immediately clear to a larger percentage of the audience than
Liquibase's DSL would be, therefore Flyway's approach is preferred.

3. Flyway is (or appears to be) faster than Liquibase at startup time

Liquibase initialization took approximately 3 seconds on an MBP against
an in-memory DB. Flyway initialization takes less than 1 second. This is
significant given that it takes overall startup time from ~12 seconds to
~8 seconds, i.e. more efficient when in a tight loop of code changes and
restarts. Note that this comparison isn't perfectly apples-to-apples, as
the Liquibase arrongement had 3 changesets whereas there is now just one
consolidated changeset under Flyway.

This commit also migrates from HSQL to H2 as the in-memory database used
for development and automated testing. The primary reason is because H2
offers an explicit ""PostgreSQL compatibility mode"", making it feasible
to configure Flyway with a unified set of SQL files, as opposed to
maintaining two copies, one for the in-memory DB and one for the
production DB. HSQL does not have this option. This change was quite
straightforward to perform - H2 was effectively a drop-in replacement,
and side-by-side comparisons of executing the test suites demonstrates
little or no difference with regard to performance.

A number of projects had duplicate dependencies on their classpaths
as a result of the same classes being available in more than one
artifact, each with different Maven coordinates. Typically this only
affected the tests, but meant that the actual classes that were
loaded was somewhat unpredictable and had the potential to vary
between an IDE and the command line depending on the order in which
the aritfacts appeared on the classpath. This commit adds a number of
exclusions to remove such duplicates.

In addition to the new exclusions, notable other changes are:

 - Spring Data JPA has been updated to 1.4.1. This brings its
   transitive dependency upon spring-data-commons into line with
   Spring LDAP's and prevents both spring-data-commons-core and
   spring-data-commons from being on the classpath
 - All Servlet API dependencies have been updated to use the official
   artifact with all transitive dependencies on unofficial servlet API
   artifacts being excluded.
 - In places, groovy has been replaced with groovy-all. This removes
   some duplicates caused by groovy's transitive dependencies.
 - JUnit has been updated to 4.11 which brings its transitive Hamcrest
   dependency into line with other components.

There appears to be a bug in Gradle which means that some exclusions
applied to an artifact do not work reliably. To work around this
problem it has been necessary to apply some exclusions at the
configuration level

* SWARM-1440: Separate build profiles further

Motivation
----------
Reduce what's built when `swarm.product.build` is set and remove testsuites from reactor for it.

Modify dependencyManagement so that testsuite modules don't have WF dependencies included to make testsuites ""cleaner"" in terms of dependencies.

Modifications
-------------
Added `build-parent` to be the parent of all artifacts we build as part of WF Swarm so that it can include any dependencies, such as feature packs, that are purely required for building.

Moved `maven-enforcer-pattern-size` into root of project.

Tweaked the build profiles so that depenendencyManagement contains appropriate WF Swarm artifacts that are then made available to testsuite modules for us. Also added some common dependencies into /testsuite so that all tests can use them.

Result
------
Doesn't impact the functioning of the product, mostly impacts what's built with `-Dswarm.product.build`.

Parse responses from Wikibase to Java objects to make them type safe. This
makes the client code less error prone, contains the JSON parser dependency
to the WikibaseRepository class and makes refactoring those classes easier.

This replaces json-simple with Jackson, which is already a dependency in
the project.

Still to check:

At this point, an invalid change will put the whole batch of changes in
error. This could happen if a field is invalid (non parseable date in a
date field, invalid integer in an integer field, ...). I'm not sure if
that's an error that is sufficiently frequent to need specific handling.
